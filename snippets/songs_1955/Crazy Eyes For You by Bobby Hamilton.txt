Crazy Eyes For You LyricsI've got crazy eyes for you, baby
I've got crazy eyes for you
Oh, yes, my darling dear
Indeed, indeed, I do
Because I love, love
I love you, oh, so true
I've got those
Crazy eyes for you
I, I've got crazy eyes for you
Oh, yes, you know, you know
You know, you know I do
Because I love, love
I love you, oh, so true
I've got those
Crazy eyes for you
Sometimes, you make
Make me feel good
Sometimes, you make
Make me feel gay
But I love you every second
I love you every minute
Every hour, hour, hour
Of the day
I, I, I, I
I've got crazy eyes for you
Oh, yes, my darling dear
Indeed, indeed, I do
Because I love, love
I love you, oh, so true
I've got those
Crazy eyes for you
Peggy, Peggy, Carol, Carol
Glenda and Jenny
Mary, Mary, Pat, Pat
Sue Anne, Marie
But most of all, my Sue
I've got those
Crazy eyes for you
Crazy, crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy, crazy
Cra-cra-cra-cra-cra
Crazy, crazy, crazy...You might also likeEmbed
