Jealousy LyricsJealousy
Is there no cure your distrust
Hurts me darling
That's for sure
Have faith in my love or set me free
You are driving me crazy with jealousy
Jealousy
You must control your suspicious heart
Controls your life and soul
Don't you realize the shame it's causing me
Making me feel like a fool by jealousy
Jealous of the air I breathe
Don't be a fool your love
I've never deceived
If you are in love
Oh, can't you see
That you're wrecking my life with jealousy
Jealousy
Is there no cure...You might also likeEmbed
