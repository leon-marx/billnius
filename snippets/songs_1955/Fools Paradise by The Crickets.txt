Fools Paradise LyricsDo you think of me darlina??
While wea??re many miles apart
Oh please be true to me my darlina??
For you are the flower of my heart
Many nights Ia??ve sat alone
And Ia??ve worried over you
But Ia??ll never worry dear
If your love is true
Please come back to me my darlina??
Cause I cana??t live while wea??re apart
Please come back to me my darlina??
For you are the flower of my heart
Many nights Ia??ve sat alone
And Ia??ve worried over you
But Ia??ll never worry dear
If your love is true
Please come back to me my darlina??
For I cana??t live while wea??re apart
Come back - come back to me my darlina??
For you are the flower of my heartYou might also likeEmbed
