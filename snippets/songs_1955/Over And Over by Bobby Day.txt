Over and Over Lyrics
(Toot, toot, toot, toot)
Well, I went to a dance the other night
Everybody went stag
I said over and over and over again
"This dance is gonna be a drag"
I said over and over and over again
"This dance is gonna be a drag"

I said over and over and over again
"This dance is gonna be a drag"
(Toot, toot, toot, toot)
What all at once it happened
Well, the prettiest in this world
A-please, won't you come over and talk to me
And be my girl?
I said, "Won't you come over and talk to me
And be my girl?"

Please, won't you come over and talk to me
And be my girl?

(Toot, toot, toot, toot)
She said that she was sorry
That I was a little bit late
She would wait and wait and wait and wait
For her steady date
She would wait and wait and wait and wait
For her steady date

She would wait and wait and wait and wait
For her steady date
You might also like
(Toot, toot, toot, toot)
And my poor heart was broken
All my life where had she been?
But I'll try over and over and over
And over again
I'll try over and over and over
And over again

I will try over and over and over
And over again

(Toot, toot, toot, toot)Embed
