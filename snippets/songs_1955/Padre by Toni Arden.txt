Padre LyricsThe day that we wed
You blessed us and said
May heaven bestow you grace
There in that holy place
We shared our first embrace
Our cottage was small
But richer than all
The palaces of a king
All day, the birds would sing
Our hearts were full of spring
Padre, padre, what happened
To our love so true
Padre, padre, in my grief
I turn to you
Then she came along
And sang him her song
And won him with honeyed lies
She of the golden eyes
Now it's my heart that cries
So I kneel and pray
The hours away
And weary my heart has grown
Wondering where love has flown
Counting my beads alone
Padre, padre, please tell me
How such things can be
Padre, padre, pray for
My love and meYou might also likeEmbed
