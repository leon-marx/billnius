Just a Dream Lyrics
Just a dream, just a dream (Just a dream)
All our plans and our all schemes (All our schemes)
How could I think you'd be mine (You'd be mine)
The lies I'd tell myself each time

I know that we could never last (Never last)
We just can't seem to in the past (In the past)
Just a dream I dream in vain (Dream in vain)
With you I'd only live in pain
Your picture is always with me
I can still hear that same mournful song
And now I sit here crying
Please leave me alone

Why, why do I love you (I love you)
How can I live in misery (Misery)
I know that I won't forget you (Forget you)
But now I know it's too late for me

Your picture is always with me
I can still hear that same mournful song
And now I sit here crying
Please leave me alone

Why, why do I love you (I love you)
How can I live in misery (Misery)
I know that I won't forget you (Forget you)
But now I know it's too late for me (Too late)You might also likeEmbed
