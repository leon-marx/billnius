She Was Only Seventeen (He Was One Year More) Lyrics
Seventeen
And He was one year more
Seventeen
And he the girl adored
Seventeen

She was only seventeen
And he was one year more
She loved him with all her heart
And he the girl adored
But all their friends believed they were
Too young to know the score

'Cause she was only seventeen
And he was one year more

Are they old enough to know
If love will last for life?
Isn't he too young
To be a husband her a wife?

Well in the past I bet it's happened
More than once before

When someone was seventeen
Another one year more

Do we have the right to question
Love that seems so strong?
As long as God has no objections
There can be no wrong?
Let us be the first to wish them
All the very best
Let us hope their love is strong
Enough to meet the test
You might also like
'Cause like I said I bet it's happened
More than once before

When someone else was seventeen
Another one year more

Do we have the right to question
Love that seems so strong?
As long as God has no objection
There can be no wrong?
Let us be the first to
Wish them all the very best
Let us hope their love is strong
Enough to meet the test

'Cause like I said I bet it's happened
More than once before

When someone else was seventeen
Another one year moreEmbed
