Try The Impossible LyricsTry the impossible, try to understand the way i feel about you
Try the incredible, for in finding all of our dreams, might come true
Try to understand you're everything i ever hoped for
And if you try to make it goodbye take my heart
It will be yours, i really mean it
When i tell you i'll be at your beck and call
Tell me you want me and our love
Will conquer all
The need for you to be with you, is the reason why i plead to you
Make the impossible the incredible and all of our dreams come true
(wee ew wee ew wee ew..ew wee ew wee ew wee ew)
I really mean it..when i tell you i'll be at your beckYou might also likeEmbed
