Young And Warm And Wonderful LyricsYoung and warm and wonderful
You are all I dreamed you'd be
Dreams that seemed improbable
All at once have come true, now I see
Every searching heart finds its happiness
Love is only a matter of time
Young and warm and wonderful at last
You're here, my love, and love is mine
Every searching heart finds its happiness
Love is only a matter of time
Young and warm and wonderful at last
You're here, my love, and love is mineYou might also likeEmbed
