Willie and the Hand Jive LyricsI know a cat named Way Out Willie
He's got a cool little chick named Rockin' Millie
He can walk and stroll and Susie Q
And do that crazy hand jive too
Papa told Willie, you'll ruin my home
You and that hand jive have got to go
Willie said, Papa, don't put me down
They're doin' the hand jive all over town
Hand jive, hand jive, hand jive, doin' that crazy hand jive
Mama, Mama look at Uncle Joe
He's doin' that hand jive with sister Flo
Grandma gave baby sister a dime
Said, do that hand jive one more time
Well, the doctor and the lawyer and Indian chief
They all dig that crazy beat
Way Out Willie gave 'em all a treat
When he did that hand jive with his feet / Hand jive...
Willie and Millie got married last fall
They had a little Willie Junior, and a-that ain't all
You know, the baby got famous in his crib, you see
Doin' that hand jive on TV / Hand jive...You might also likeEmbed
