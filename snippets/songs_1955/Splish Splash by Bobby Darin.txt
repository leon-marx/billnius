Splish Splash Lyrics
Splish splash, I was taking a bath
Long about a Saturday night, yeah
A rub dub, just relaxing in the tub
Thinking everything was alright
Well, I stepped out the tub, put my feet on the floor
I wrapped the towel around me
And I opened the door, and then a
Splish, splash, I jumped back in the bath
Well, how was I to know there was a party going on?
They was a-splishing and a-splashing
Reeling with the feeling
Moving and a-grooving
Rocking and a-rolling, yeah

Bing bang, I saw the whole gang
Dancing on my living room rug, yeah
Flip flop, they was doing the bop
All the teens had the dancing bug
There was Lollipop with-a Peggy Sue
Good golly, Miss Molly was-a even there, too
A-well-a, splish splash, I forgot about the bath
I went and put my dancing shoes on, yeah

I was a rolling and a-strolling
Reeling with the feeling
Moving and a-grooving
Splishing and a-splashing, yeah


Yes, I was a-splishing and a-splashing
I was a-rolling and a-strolling
Yeah, I was a-moving and a-grooving
We was a-reeling with the feeling
We was a-rolling and a-strolling
Moving with the grooving
Splish splash, yeah

Mm, splishing and a-splashing, one time
I was a-splishing and a-splashing, ooo wee
I was a-moving and a-grooving, yeah
I was a-splishing and a-splashing1Embed
