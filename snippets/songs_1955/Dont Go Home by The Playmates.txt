Dont Go Home LyricsDon't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave the party yet
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Now that we have finally met
Can't you see I came to the party
'cause I knew that you'd be here?
Dance with me and stay at the party
So that I can hold you near
Don't go home, my little darlin'
'cause I'm so in love with you
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Till you learn to love me too
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave the party yet
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Now that we have finally met
I have waited up for the party
'cause I knew we'd finally meet
When I saw you here at the party
Then it made my world complete
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave me up a tree
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Don't go home, please stay with me
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Please don't leave the party yet
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Now that we have finally met
Can't you see I came to the party
'cause I knew that you'd be here?
Dance with me and stay at the party
So that I can hold you near
Don't go home, my little darlin'
'cause I'm so in love with you
Don't go home, my little darlin'
Till you learn to love me too
