Kathy-O LyricsKathy-O, Kathy-O
How do your secrets grow?
Why do you do the things that you do?
Kathy-O, Kathy-O
Why do you taunt me so?
I never know just what you will do
As you dream by the window?
Bewitched by a star
Are you angel or devil
I wonder what you are
Kathy-O, Kathy-O
Strange little Kathy-O
I'll always love you
