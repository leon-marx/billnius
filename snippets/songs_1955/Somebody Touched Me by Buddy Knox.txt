Somebody Touched Me LyricsFeat. The Rhythm Orchids
Boppa you, boppa you...
Well, you gotta get the rhythm
If you're gonna rock
You got to get moving
And don't stop
Here we go
Oh, here we go
Now here we go
(Here we go)
Well, somebody touched me
In the dark last night
Yes, somebody touched me
In the dark last night
Somebody moved me
With all her might
She thrilled my soul
When she held me tight
Yeah, who, who, who
In the dark last night
Last night
A stranger (a stranger)
Took my hand (took my hand)
Last night
A stranger (a stranger)
Took my hand (took my hand)
Last night
A stranger took my hand
Said you're gonna be
My lover man
Yeah, who, who, who
In the dark last night
Boppa you, boppa you...
Well, now you got the rhythm
So don't stop
We're gonna move on
With a roll and rock
Now here we go
Oh, here we go
Now here we go
(Here we go)
Well, somebody made me
Fall in love last night
Yes, somebody made me
Fall in love last night
Somebody made me fall in love
Set my heart and soul above
Oh, who, who, who
In the dark last night
Last night
A stranger (a stranger)
Took my hand (took my hand)
Last night
A stranger (a stranger)
Took my hand (took my hand)
Last night
A stranger took my hand
Said you're gonna be
My lover man
Yeah, who, who, who
In the dark last night
Oh, oh, oh, oh...You might also likeEmbed
