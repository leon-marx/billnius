Do You Want To Dance? Lyrics
Well do you want to dance and hold my hand?
Tell me I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you want to dance?
Well do you want to dance and make romance?
Sweep me all through the night
Oh baby, do you want to dance?
Well do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze me all through the night
Oh baby, do you want to dance?
Well do you want to dance and hold my hand?
Squeeze me, tell me I'm your man
Oh baby, do you want to dance?
Well, do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze, kiss me all through the night
Oh baby, do you want to dance?
Well do you want to dance and make romance?
Kiss and squeeze me, mmm yes
Do you want to dance?

Well do you want to dance and hold my hand?
Squeeze me, tell me I'm your lover man
Oh baby, do you want to dance?
Well ,do you want to dance under the moonlight?
Squeeze and hug me all through the night
Oh baby, do you want to dance?
Well do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you want to dance?
Do you, do you, do you want to dance?You might also likeEmbed
