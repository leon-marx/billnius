A Certain Smile LyricsA certain smile, a certain face
Can lead an unsuspecting heart
On a merry chase
A fleeting glance
Can say so many lovely things
Suddenly you know why my heart sings
You love awhile and when love goes
You try to hide the tears inside
With a cheerful pose
But in the hush of night
Exactly like a bittersweet refrain
Comes that certain smile
To haunt your heart again
But in the hush of night
Exactly like a bittersweet refrain
Comes that certain smile
To haunt your heart againYou might also likeEmbed
