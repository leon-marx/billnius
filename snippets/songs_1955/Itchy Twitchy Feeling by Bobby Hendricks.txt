Itchy Twitchy Feeling LyricsDih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dip
Dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dih dip
Sitting here wondering what it's all about
This rock and roll music that makes you shout
You tune in on Bandstand and they're jumping like mad
And the dance that they're doing it don't look bad
You get that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
You don't understand it but it sure feels nice
You thought you might try it 'bout a once or twice
You started with that dance they call the stroll
But you felt much better doing rock and roll
You get that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs are flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
You don't understand it but it sure feels nice
You thought you might try it 'bout a once or twice
You started with that dance they call the stroll
But you felt much better doing rock and roll
You get that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs are flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
You come in the house with your hair all in
Nobody had to ask you where you been
You come in the house, you're still jumping like mad
I seen a lot of people with it but a you've got it bad
You got that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
I don't understand it why you go go go
There must be something 'bout this music that I don't know
I went to a hop and it didn't take long
I got the feeling something was a going wrong
You got that itchy twitchy feeling
You start rocking and a reeling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yapping
You're a rocking and a rolling
Soon your arms and legs start flapping
Like a hound dog mouth a yappingYou might also likeEmbed
