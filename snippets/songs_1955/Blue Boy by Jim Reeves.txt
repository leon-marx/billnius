Blue Boy LyricsBlue boy, that's what they call me
'Cause I'm so lonely, since I lost you
Blue boy, I'm known as blue boy
You've found a new boy, and now we're through
Chorus:
I had a twinkle in my eye
When our sweet love was new
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you
Blue Boy, I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me, as I need you
Chorus:
(I had a twinkle in my eye)
(When our sweet love was new,)
Now all I do is moan and cry
And hunger after you
Blue Boy, I'll be a blue boy
Until you need me, as I need you
(Blue boy)
As I need you
