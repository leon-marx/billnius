Apple Valley LyricsMy father used to give me 16 quarters for the coin-op
My mother used to try to give me orders I would boycott
I ignored good advice like it was poison
Palms pressed on head again to make the voice stop
Arm, leg, leg arm, head then Rakim
Coming out the noise box running from my choices
I never listened to the television
Hellish visions in my cell still they sell me prisons
Embellishments that I tell in prisms
Spll it eloquent without it feel irrelvant
Angels not compelled to visit
Cell-division when I split in half
Evil Ed its simple math I bleed a bit
For every single secret kept
And the terror builds a hundred fold
Please remove these bloody clothes
Carousel of ugly bones
Where it stops nobody knows
Bullet wounds like honeycombs
Poking through my sunny skull
Ghosts of you still humming slow
Welcome to the nothing show
I used to wake up to sunlight in the orchard rows
Rosebuds ho-hum glum like Im Orson Welles
Spoke a different language Orca whale
Stuck inside a war Othello summer nights in tortoise shells
Feeling like Im born to kill morbid stills clung to lungs Bordetella
My father used to read me horror tales
Words struck me like a scorpion tail
Every years the same now no more footprints on the playground...
Days passed like a train passed slowly
Flames massed beneath grey-cast skylines
I stayed sick I wouldnt take that quinine
Bright light life became plain black twilight
Why lie? waylaid into nothingness
I used to find fireflies under honey crisps
Age made fine wine out of uglinessYou might also likeEmbed
