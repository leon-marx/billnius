2017 Rap-Up Lyrics
They say it was a crazy year
They just need me to wrap it up
Whole lotta lovin and a whole lotta hatin
This is how it went down
I dont know where the fuck to start
Yall been waitin so I gotta make it

I never seen a year like this year, so many twists and turns
Winners and losers  we all lived and learned
So listen up, Ima keep it a buck
This the Mad Skillz 2017 Wrap Up
Homie I watched Nicki drop Meek like he wont even 
Saw a million women march through the DC streets
When guy got jumped out the Super Bowl that had me weak
And yall was tripping over dude sprinklin salt on meat
Then they mixed the Oscars up, cmon bro
To this day I still havent heard Despacito
Seem like soon as Trump got in
Beyonce broke the whole internet like Bitch, here come the twins!
And shout to Jordan Peele cause he a beast
For real cause Get Out was a modern day masterpiece
Had the whole world buzzin
A slave movie disguised as a horror movie and nobody saw it comin
Some of yall should sit down, bitch be humble
Music had a little rap and had a whole lotta mumble
And North Korea tryna to leave us ruined
Baby you all over the place! What is you doin?!
And Kendall Jenner, girl you funny, girl dont test me
You cant stop a protest with a can of Pepsi
And yall showed the backpack kid a lot of love
And I still dont know what a fidget spinner does
Lotta wild wild thoughts, gettin it in
And if all your friends are dead, you should get new friends
I feel bad for Rob Kardashian
He just woke up and old girl was gone in the wind
Im like Rob heres a tip, Blac Chyna just boonked you
And thats a whole lotta gang shit
Found out Russia really had us hacked
And Putin, catch me outside, how bout dat
And the song of the year, Cardi B had a heater
Insecure was a hit, shout to Molly and Issa
LaVar Ball, I like his style
He probably somewhere talkin shit to somebody right now
We got tired of seein dude in the news
But I still copped a pair, so dont get it confused
I see you and I dont speak, that means you lose
On top of that, Im still waitin on my bloody shoes
And Khloes little baby bump finally showed up
And Tiffany Haddish, I respect the glow up
She killed the Girls Trip movie
Excuse me, do it look like I was left off Bad and Boujee?
And Lala and Melo couldnt stay together
Floyd and McGregor got it on for the cheddar
I pray for everybody affected in Manchester
And Kevin Hart, boy you gotta do better
And ladies watch ya man cause you might get played
Sza out here takin dudes for like three whole days
Then Kyrie dipped, Taylor came back Swift
And Lonzo Ball let me down like the solar eclipse
Racists runnin through Charlottesville
Yall out here tryna turn Bitcoins to bills
And J Lo and A Rod fell in love
And we never found out what covfefe was
And Sean Spicer took a L
And then Trump started beefin with the NFL
Man, Im with Kap I got you
Because you stood up bro and didnt let them stop you
The other players, man I got to dock you
Yall coulda did somethin special and yall chose not to
Yall want the facts? Yall looked so wack
And usually Im out here rootin for everybody Black
Maybe well get there one day
But we couldnt even stop watchin games on a Sunday
And then the storms came north and south
You got fires in the west tryna take Cali out
And shout Wonder Woman no doubt
Cause you gon have to be one just to get up out of R. Kellys house
Slaves in Libya, that hurt my soul
And if you ask me, yes we need gun control
I mean after Vegas?! Cmon son
And then the next day yall go and buy more guns?!
And Harvey Weinstein out here wildin
Touched like 45 women and they wouldnt be silenced
Stop with the sexual violence!
45 though bro?! Thats like a Chris Brown album
This whole year was crazy
And Im just shaking my head at dumbass Kevin Spacey
It dont work that way
You dont get to apologize and come out as gay
You better get a grip, dont play
Cause yeen about to walk away from this like Keyser Soze
And Hov took a shot at Ye
Triple 4s for the ball
They let you out, OJ?
Oh you trippin trippin, you still a busta
Damn shame how yall was out here draggin' Usher
Then Wendy fainted, man yall was scared
Im in LA, I heard her ass hit the ground over here (Was that me?)
Mase dissed Cam, went straight for his dome
And if you know Tyrese, please take his phone
Royal engagements, celeb breakups
They tryna take the net, yall better wake up
Serena had a baby and took that jump
Eminem got in his bag and he came for Trump
And he the years biggest blunder
Everyday we wake up and just wait for him to do somethin dumber
Lookin at the sun, what nobody told him?
If he did have some shades, LiAngelo stole em
And yall bullied that kid, not funny
Then turn around and gave his ma that money
Lets make this clear  I need mine
Yall bully me for this damn song every year
Bye Bye Matt Lauer  it couldve been worse
You couldve been raining from power
And speaking of Power thats my shit
Its still lit, ayo good lookin out on the beef Fif
And Black Thought had the verse of the year
Shout Meek Mill, we know them folks aint fair
We had pink trap houses, mollies, percocets
They draggin old people off United jets (Leave him alone!)
Aye what them chicks like to say?
Aye girl, sometimes you just gotta throw the whole year away
So before I sign off
I send a rest in peace to everybody we lost
Hey you can wipe your slate clean
This is Mad Skillz, welcome to 2018
