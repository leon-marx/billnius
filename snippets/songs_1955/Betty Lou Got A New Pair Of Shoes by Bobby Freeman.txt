Betty Lou Got a New Pair of Shoes Lyrics
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes, woo
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou  wah-ooh, wah-ooh, wah-ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well, she walked in the shoe-store, picked out a shoe
She tried on a twelve, but that wouldn't do
Betty Lou, Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou bought a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou  wah-ooh, wah-ooh, wah-ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well, she cracked up over the solid fit
Walkin' down the street with her brand new kit

Betty Lou, Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou  wah-ooh, wah-ooh, wah-ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoe

Well, she's walkin' down the street, she met an undertaker
He tried to bury her new Shudebakers

Betty Lou, Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou wah-ooh, wah-ooh, wah-ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of yeah!

Well, she went to a rock 'n' roll party the other night
Someone stepped on her Shudebakers and she started a fight!

Betty Lou, Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou  wah-ooh, wah-ooh, wah-ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes

Well, she walked in the shoe-store, gave the man a tip
She told him to go buy himself a rocket ship

Betty Lou, Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes
Betty Lou wah-ooh, wah-ooh, wah-ooh
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoe, yeah

Betty Lou got a new pair of shoes, woo
Look at her walkin' down the street, yeah
Wooh, she's steppin' higher than a kite
Yeah, them shiny new Shudebakers she's got on
Whoa, dig them kits, yeah
Betty Lou got a new pair of shoesEmbed
