Medley: Volare (Nel Blu, Dipinto Di Blu)/An Evening In Roma (Live At The Sands Hotel, Las Vegas/1963) LyricsVolare, oh oh
E cantare, oh oh oh oh
No wonder my happy heart sings
Your love has given me wings
Penso che un sogno cosi non ritorni mai piu
Mi dipingevo le mani e la faccia (laughter) di blu
 d'improvviso venivo dal vento rapito
E incominciavo a volare nel cielo infinito
Down each avenue or via, street or strata
You can see 'em disappearing two by two
On an evening in Roma
Do they take 'em for espresso?
Yeah, I guess so
On each lover's arm, a girl I wish I knew
On an evening in Roma
Though there's grinning and mandolining in sunny Italy
The beginning has just begun whn the sun goes down
So pleas meet me in the plaza near your casa
I am only one and one is much too few
On an evening in Roma
Don't know what the country's coming to
But in Rome, do as they do
Will you, on an evening in Roma?
On an evening in Roma
Sotto il cielo di Roma
On an evening in RomaEmbed
