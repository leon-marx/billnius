Youre Making a Mistake LyricsYou're making a mistake
So a-help me
So a-help me, I do love you
You're making a mistake
So a-help me
Oh believe me, I've never been untrue
Even though they've made you cry
Darling you're making a mistake
So a-help me
Help me prove that they told a lieYou might also likeEmbed
