Leroy LyricsI know a boy who was never blue
Now he lives in Cellblock Two
I don't know just why he's blue
Leroy, what'd you do?
Leroy's back in jail again
Leroy's back in jail again
I don't know why, why he's blue
Leroy, what'd you do?
Went to the judge, dig man wail
I'm here and I got Leroy's bail
Judge said son, don't cha tell me no tale
Leroy, he's gonna stay in jail
Now, Leroy says man, you tried the best
Man, I'm here gonna take a rest
I've seen Minny, she's got the blues
She let you wear my long pointed shoes
Now, Leroy's heart is a bowl of hate
Leroy, he just can't go straight
Tell my Minny, I can't keep my date
I'm gonna be 'bout six months lateYou might also likeEmbed
