What Am I Living For LyricsWhat am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do
What am longing for, each lonely night?
To feel your lips to mine and hold you tight
You'll be my little girl my whole life through
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will do
I want you close to me, that's all I know
I want you all the time, cause darling I love you so
What am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
What am I living for, if not for you?
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do
Oh, nobody else, nobody else will do
Baby, nobody else, nobody else will doYou might also likeEmbed
