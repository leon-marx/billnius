I had a date for the hop last night
Up to her door everything seemed right
But to my surprise as I opened the door
I couldn't tell the front from the back
"Cause she was wearin' a sack dress
Whew what a mess!
The last time I saw her, man what a shape!!
And now she's got a shape like an egg!
No chemise, please, not for me, please
Well you can take back the sack, leave it hangin' on the rack
And bring a sweater back!!
When we arrived at the hop
We started in doin' the stroll
I told her I wanted to stop
But she wanted rock and roll
I told her forty times and it really was a crime
I was talkin' to the back of her head!!
No chemise, please, not for me, please
Well you can take back the sack, leave it hangin' on the rack
And bring a sweater back!!---yeah
(instrumental interlude)
Sure would like to find the creator
Who covered up my baby in this tent
He musta been a woman-hater
I keep wonderin' where the wiggle went
So won't you change the fad, have pity on me please
Put 'er back in her dungarees
No chemise, please, not for me, please
Well you can take back the sack, leave it hangin' on the rack
And bring a sweater back!!
No chemise, please, not for me, please
Well you can take back the sack, leave it hangin' on the rack
Bring a sweater back!!You might also likeEmbed
