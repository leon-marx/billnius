Rainbows (live 2001) LyricsYou gotta have rain
To have a rainbow
You gotta have dick
To have a dick in your mouth
You gotta skin a rich kid
To wear a rich kid suit
And you've gotta know by now I think you're cute
The problem with kids today is they're
Always thinkin' bout getting laid
When they should just play some games
Like stick the dick in the hole
And you wanna know something grand?
The other night I met a guy named Chad
And he liked doing other things
Like playing hockey YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH NO
And I hear you got a digeridoo
And ah a (?) too
Why don't you come over and jam?
Heya remember that time you f**ked the jelly?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! NO!
Then came two
Me and you
You and me
And we're standing on our feet
Then came she
Then came he
They were we
Now we're flyin' on our wings
Into the night
We took our might
Black or white
With the power of our dreams, the power of our dreams
Gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelet
She takes her coffee with a cigarette
She misses people she hasn't even met
She is me and you are listening to me sing
And you've got to want to f**k me
And you've gotta want to tickle my peeney
And you've gotta want to rub my vagiiineeeey
Hey, after this who wants to go shit in a condom with me?
If you f**kin' do, say CHA CHA CHA!
AUDIENCE: CHA CHA CHA!!!
