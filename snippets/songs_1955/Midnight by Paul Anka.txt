Midnight LyricsMidnight
Is for lovers
So let's Ispoon
Beneath the moon
The silv'ry moon
A up a high
Midnight
We'll be together
At lover's lane
We'll kiss again
And then again
A at midnight
You hold my hand
And you drive me in sane
You're burning up my heart
And you tickle my brain
Your eyes are blue
Your lips are red
The old hootie owl way
Up in a tree
Is taking a peek at
You and me
I don't care what it can seeYou might also likeEmbed
