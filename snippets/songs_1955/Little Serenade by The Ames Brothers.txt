Melodie DAmour LyricsMelodie d'amour, take this song to my lover
Shoo shoo little bird, go and find my love
Melodie d'amour, serenade at her window
Shoo shoo little bird, sing my song of love
Oh tell her I will wait, if she names a date
Tell her that I care, more than I can bear
For when we are apart, how it hurts my heart
So fly oh fly away and say that I hope and pray
This lovers melody will bring her back to me
Melodie d'amour, take this song to my lover
Shoo shoo little bird, go and find my love
Melodie d'amour, serenade at her window
Shoo shoo little bird, tell her of my love
Oh tell her how I yearn, long for her return
Say I miss her so, more than she could know
For when we are apart, how it hurts my heart
So fly oh fly away and say that I hope and pray
This lover's melody will bring her back to me
Melodie d'amour, serenade at her window
Shoo shoo little bird, tell her of my loveYou might also likeEmbed
