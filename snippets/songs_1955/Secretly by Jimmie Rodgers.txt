Secretly LyricsDo do do do do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do do do do do
Why must I meet you in a secret rendevous
Why must we steal away to steal a kiss or two
Why must we wait to do the things we want to do
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Wish we didn't have to meet, secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss, secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid to show the world that we're in love
Till we have the right to meet, openly
Till we have the right to kiss, openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love, secretly
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Wish we didn't have to meet, secretly
Wish we didn't have to kiss, secretly
Wish we didn't have to be afraid to show the world that we're in love
Till we have the right to meet, openly
Till we have the right to kiss, openly
We'll just have to be content to be in love, secretlyYou might also like1Embed
