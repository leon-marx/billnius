Just Like In The Movies LyricsJust like in the movies
Let's pretend we fall in love
Make believe we're lovers
With a paper moon above
We swam the South Pacific
Built a bridge on River Kwai
Around the world I follow you
We love, we part, we cry
Just like in the movies
We can make up with a kiss
I confess I like it
When I hold you close like this
Here's the crazy happy ending
Baby, I was not pretending
Just like in the movies
I love you
Here's the crazy happy ending
Baby, baby, I was not pretending
Just like in the movies
I love youYou might also likeEmbed
