Win Your Love for Me Lyrics
Woah oh, little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Woah oh, little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)
Woah oh oh oh oh (Your love for me)
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)
Manys the day I've longed for you
To hold you in my arms
Many's the night I've cried for you
And for your many charms
If you'd only come to me
My heart wouldn't be full of sorrow
But now, all I can do is hope and pray
That you will come to me tomorrow

Woah oh, little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)
Woah oh oh oh oh (Your love for me)
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)

To me you are so beautiful
Beautiful as a song
And whenever I look at you
My heart beat like the tom-tom
If you'd only come to me
This torch I wouldn't have to carry
And if everything goes right
To the church, we'll go to marry
You might also like
Woah oh, little girl
How happy I would be
If some miracle could win your love for me
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)
Win your love (Your love) for me (For me)
Woah, how I wish a miracle (Your love for me)
Could winEmbed
