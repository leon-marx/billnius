Stupid Cupid LyricsStupid cupid
You're a real mean guy
I'd like to clip your wings
So you can't fly
I'm in love
And it's a crying shame
And I know that you're the one to blame
Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
I can't do my homework
And I can't think straight
I meet him every morning
'Bout a half past eight
I'm acting like a lovesick fool
You've even got me carrying his books to school
Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
You mixed me up
But good
Right from the very start
Hey, go play Robin Hood with somebody else's heart
You've got me jumping
Like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
You might also likeYou've got me jumping like a crazy clown
And I don't feature what you're putting down
Since I kissed his loving lips of wine
The thing that bothers me is that I like it fine
Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
Hey, hey
Set me free
Stupid cupid
Stop picking on me
