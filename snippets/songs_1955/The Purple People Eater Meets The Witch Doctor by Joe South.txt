The Purple People Eater Meets the Witch Doctor LyricsWhile strolling through the woods
Not so far from town
I got real shook
I heard the strangest sound
I saw the Purple People Eater
And to my surprise
I saw the Witch Doctor sittin' by his side
Woah!
The Witch Doctor had a guitar in his hand
They were boppin' and a-rockin'
With a two-piece band
Well the Purple was a blowin'
Like a People Eater should
The Witch Doctor picked
Like a Johnny B. Goode
They went a-
(Oooh eee
Oooh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)
Yeah, the Doctor got trouble
When the People Eater said
"The girls keep a-laughin'
At the horn in my head"
Then the Witch Doctor smiled
And I heard him say
(Yeah man, you're ugly
But you sure can play)
Well there in the moonlight
It seemed so strange
While he played a little chorus of-a
Home on the Range
You might also likeThey were comin' in strong
Like a rock n' roll star
With the craziest beat
This side of Mars
They went a-
(Oooh eee
Oooh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)
Yeah, these cats from outer space
They were givin' it all
I could tell the way they jumped it
They were havin' a ball
They had me pattin' my feet
And just a-clappin' my hands
They stopped just long enough to say
(Crazy man)
Yeah
Twilight time
When the sun goes down
Way back up in the woods
Along the edge of town
Yeah, the people all gather
From a-miles around
To hear Doc and Ol' Purple with that crazy sound
They went a-
(Oooh eee
Oooh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)
One more time
(Okay)
(Oooh eee
Oooh ah ah
Ting tang
Walla walla bing bang)
(Wait til they see us on the Bandstand
Crazy man, crazy
Walla walla bing bang)
(Ha ha ha ha)Embed
