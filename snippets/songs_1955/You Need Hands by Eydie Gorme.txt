You Need Hands LyricsYou need hands
To hold someone you care for
You need hands
To show that you're sincere
When you feel
Nobody wants to know you
You need hands
To brush away your tear
When you hold a brand new baby
You need tender hands to guide them on their way
You need hands
To thank the Lord for living
And for giving us this dayYou might also likeEmbed
