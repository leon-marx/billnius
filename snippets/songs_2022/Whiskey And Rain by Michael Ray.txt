Whiskey And Rain Lyrics
It's been a downpour, beating on the tin roof
It's been Black Label pouring on ice
Made a honky-tonk outta this living room
Yeah, swimming through her goodbye
Misery loves company

Yeah, whiskey and rain coming down, coming down
Splash of bourbon in a glass
Yeah, pouring something on the pain, let it drown, let it drown
Try to wash away the past, oh-oh-oh
Since my blue sky sunshine whole life hopped
On that midnight train
'Til the bottle runs out or the clouds roll away
It's just whiskey and rain
It's been nothing but a hangover tryna get over you
But Lord willing and the creek don't rise
I'm gonna wake up in the morning feeling brand new
Without a single cloud in the sky, oh-oh
But tonight it ain't the weather breaking

Yah, whiskey and rain coming down, coming down
Splash of bourbon in a glass
Yeah, pouring something on th pain, let it drown, let it drown
Try to wash away the past, oh-oh-oh
Since my blue sky sunshine whole life hopped
On that midnight train
'Til the bottle runs out or the clouds roll away
It's just whiskey and rain

Misery loves company

Yeah, whiskey and rain coming down, coming down
Splash of bourbon in a glass
Yeah, pouring something on the pain, let it drown, let it drown
Try to wash away the past, oh-oh-oh
Since my blue sky sunshine whole life hopped
On that midnight train
'Til the bottle runs out or the clouds roll away
It's just whiskey and rain
'Til the bottle runs out or the clouds roll away
It's just whiskey and rain  Whiskey and rain coming down, coming down
Splash of bourbon in a glassYou might also like2Embed
