TranslationsPortuguesPoppin Lyrics
I need my drugs, I need my love (We get high)
Bitches pullin' up and they suck us up (Hey)
I'm in that Tonka, baby, yeah, come show me love (Ooh)
I don't fuck with nobody, lil' bitch, I show you nothin' (Show you nothin')
I ain't trustin' nobody, lil' bitch, I keep a gun
If a problem come up (Yeah), you know I'm not gon' run
Feel like Osama to us 'cause we blow up like a bomb
Yeah, roll him like a filter, yeah, then smoke him like a bong (Phew)

We been outside, man, all day
We just countin' racks, yeah, all day, don't play (Huh, huh, huh)
We been outside, man (Ooh)
Yeah
We been outside, man (BenjiCold, why you icy?)
We got racks out, bitch, we going shoppin' (Shoppin', shoppin', shoppin')
We get like this, you wish, lil' bitch, we poppin' (We poppin')
It ain't been a day that I ain't been high, bitch, Prcs', I pop 'em
Yeah, they told m that they broke, that's not my problem (That's not my problem)
Yeah, you know he test the gang, you know we pop him (Boom, boom, boom)
Yeah, we ain't got time to play, we outside, poppin' (LA, LA, LA)
Yeah, I told my bitch I need one, need a topper, a bopper
I pulled inside this Lamb', I chopped it up like helicopter (Vroom, vroom, vroom)
Slide in the coupes, we fucked the driveway up (Skrrt, skrrt)
Hopped inside the mansion, fucked the drywall up
Kickin' holes in the wall and fuckin' hoes in my drawers
I don't feel the same at all, I'm having Percocet withdrawals
No, you don't know me like you said you did, you don't know me, not at all (The fuck?)
You might catch me in the Tesla 'cause it's drivin', I'm nodding off
Yeah, they tried to show me that music, told that bitch to turn it off
And we pulled up to the show, we turned they city up a notch, yeah

I need my drugs, I need my love (We get high)
Bitches pullin' up and they suck us up (Hey)
