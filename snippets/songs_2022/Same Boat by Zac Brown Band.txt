Same Boat Lyrics
We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes
We're all in the same boat

We could all believe what we believe
Peacefully agree to disagree
But you can't judge a man
Until you walk a country mile in his shoes
Dood'n-doo-doo-doo
We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat

We all been kicked and knocked around
But you ain't gonna keep a good man down
You can run like hell from your mistakes
But you can't hide from your truth
Rood'n-doo-doo-doo

We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat

Share them peaches if you're holdin'
Take those shots and keep reloadin'
If you can't be nice, don't say nothin' at all
So help somebody who might be strugglin'
Spread a little love, gotta give back somethin'
If this ship keeps rockin', we'll all go overboard
You might also like
We're all in the same boat
Fishin' in the same hole
Wonderin' where the same time goes, and money too
Tryin' to fix the same broke hearts
Wishin' on the same stars
We're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat
Yeah, we're all hopin' hope floats
We're all in the same boat1Embed
