Poke It Out Lyrics
(Cool N Dre)
Go, go, go, go, go
Listen (Go, go, let's go)

I just wanna see if you gon' lie or you gon' love me
I was gettin' broads way before I got the money, honey
Since I been a star, they don't love me
The ceilin' got stars when the star got no ceiling
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out)
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
Yeah, she got a little butt, so what?
Big bag, she can show enough
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
My regards to the broads that thought I was done
Pick a side, pick a side and die on the joint
I been lettin' things slide, they tryin' too hard
'Cause I ain't left the city once, still travel abroad
Nigga, I'm back on my boss shit
The stick in the Honda Civic, we in the car service
I really just mind my business and pray that God sort 'em
Can't really be long winded
You talkin' short money, today, we not cost cuttin'
Can you stick it out?
Told me she was quarantined, them brand new titties out
And it might be a couple weeks to make them bitches bounce
So I mean it when I be like, "What's the turn around?"
No, really, turn around, okay

I just wanna see if you gon' lie or you gon' love me
I was gettin' broads way before I got the money, honey
Since I been a star, they don't love me
The ceilin' got stars when the star got no ceiling
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out)
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
Yeah, she got a little butt, so what?
Big bag, she can show enough
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah

Turn around, I wanna see (I wanna see)
Do it look like how it look on IG? (Mm)
Bad from every angle, she got herself a trainer
I know that nigga can't help but take a little peek, uh
Cole World and Folarin co-starrin'
We both flexin', Bo Jacksons, bogartin'
These cap niggas that rap with piss-poor jargon
My latest whip, my latest chick was both foreign
I know all my hoes miss me
I been the shit since I hit elementary
She know who run it, the one that keep it hunnid
To find a better nigga, you gon' have to live a century (Century)
Evidently, the coach can't bench me
The franchise player, I don't know how to miss
And they can't buy a layup, I'm anti what they are
I can't take my eyes off your pants, I swear
Girl, you shinin' like a damn Moncler
I'm thinkin' we should dip like the Cam'ron era
If you the big steppa, I'm the landmine here
That's the one they know they can't come near

I just wanna see if you gon' lie or you gon' love me
I was gettin' broads way before I got the money, honey
Since I been a star, they don't love me
The ceilin' got stars when the star got no ceiling
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out)
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
Yeah, she got a little butt, so what?
Big bag, she can show enough
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
Stick it out (Stick it out), poke it out (Poke it out), yeah
Break it down, look
Poke it out, I wanna
See you play whether you
Meg Thee Stallion or like
Coi Leray, okay
I just wanna see if you gon' lie or you gon' love me
I was gettin' broads way before I got the money, honey
Since I been a star, they don't love me
The ceilin' got stars in there, boy
Stop playin'3Embed
