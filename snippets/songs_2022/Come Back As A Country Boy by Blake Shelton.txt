Come Back as a Country Boy Lyrics
When I die, I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be

My back is always breakin', my dogs are always barkin'
My money has trouble makin' and my truck has trouble startin'
I'm up before the sun, either haulin' hay or huntin'
My work ain't ever done, but son, I wouldn't trade it for nothin'
So, when I die I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be

Yeah, if y'all ain't in my drawl and a fish ain't on my wall
And the whiskey don't burn goin' down
My feet ain't in a holler, and blue ain't on my collar
Leave my Hank-crankin', beer-drinkin' ass in the ground

Yeah, when I die I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be

When I die I wanna come back as a country boy
Live on this land like my old man did before me
I don't wanna be born into money, where the boots don't ever get muddy
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be

Yeah, when I die I wanna come back as a country boy
No, there ain't no better life if you ask me
If my neck don't come out red, then Lord, just keep me dead
'Cause a country boy's all that I know how to be
Yeah, a country boy's all that I know how to beYou might also like1Embed
