TranslationsTurkceEspanolWhen Im Alone Lyrics
We made a pact, you'd take me back, always, again
I'm bleedin' out, I need you now, can't let you win
I want it all, I want it all, I push so hard, I break it
My only home went down in smoke
It's bittersweet, I taste it
So, are you lonely? 'Cause I'm healin' slowly
In a moment, your memory is fading on me
Got no expectations now that I'm forsaken
Let's see what I'm made of, find out if I can take it, now
When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?

All I wanted was a piece of decent on the side (On the side)
When we go to bed, she be creepin' on my side (On my side)
I was drinkin' all day, I let her spend the night
When I took her home, she left somethin' in my ride, in my ride (Damn)
Then my baby found out
Now I'm livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
Ain't that bad, I got room service
Livin' in a hotel, livin' in a hotel
What your life like? Need a lifeline right now
Ninety-nine nights, tryna get my mind right now
Life is sour, even when I'm in the limelight now
But I try somehow

When I'm alone, pretend I'm letting you go
Just tell me who to blame for this
When wakin' up, feels like a punch in the gut
Just tell me, who's to blame for this?
