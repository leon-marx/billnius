Call for shelter 'cause I'm so sick, ah
You can make it come quick
Hard to think straight
'Cause I'm so down for you, licorice stick
Call for shelter 'cause I'm so sick, ah
You can make it come quick
Hard to think straight
'Cause I'm so down for you, licorice stick

I got to take you home
We're living in hard times, we're living in hard times
Baby, you think you know
I think it's about time that you're gonna make me whine
Baby, you don't wanna leave, you'll be sorry
'Cause, honestly, I can make you feel better any day
Look at what you've done for me, I call it how I see
You belong with me

Call for shelter 'cause I'm so sick, ah
You can make it come quick
Hard to think straight
'Cause I'm so down for you, licorice stick
Call for shelter 'cause I'm so sick, ah
You can make it come quick
Hard to think straight
'Cause I'm so down for you, licorice stick

Tell me I got you, baby
I wanna know how you taste, I wanna know how you taste
Now that you keep me warm
Baby, I'll call you fire and maybe I'll be your fire

Baby, you don't wanna leave, you'll be sorry
'Cause, honestly, I can make you feel better any day
Look at what you've done for me, I call it how I see
You belong with me

Call for shelter 'cause I'm so sick, ah
You can make it come quick
Hard to think straight
'Cause I'm so down for you, licorice stick
