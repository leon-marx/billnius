TranslationsEspanolPortuguesBussin Lyrics
Yeah, my connect just now sent my wrist back
Tell these bitches, "Give my drip back"
Strawberry Ferrari, whip that
Like to look back when he h-h-h-h-hit that
Ass and thighs, that's where I'm thick at
Told his ex she ain't gettin' that dick back
I call Baby, "Yo, where that stick at?"
Tell that boy come get his shit back
If they act up, we gon' fix that
My new nigga ain't with that chit-chat
You know you ain't gettin' your bitch back
Yeah, I do it, bitch, I did that
Wish a bitch would, I ain't takin' my wish back (Woo)
This cost half a ticket, plus tax
Big ol' Draco for a mishap
It say "Barbie" on my wrist tat'
I ain't at the bus stop, but my niggas bust back (Bust back)
VVS's bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin' (Queen)

We run shit, no question
Bad lil' bitch get wet, I'm bussin'
Don't like good boys, I like hustlers
I don't talk a lot, I got a few questions
I'm that guy, don't miss your blssings
Life's too short to be 'round her stressin'
Ass so fat, when she walk, dress lift up
Nobody move but us, it's a stickup (Brr)
SF90 sound like it got hiccups
No matter what, when I call, I pick up
Tell me all the business, I ain't spillin' my teacup
Go to sleep in Paris, wakin' up in Mykonos
I'ma lil' busy, go shoppin' 'til I finish
Send-send me with an AMEX, I don't need a limit
Every-every bit of seven hundred, this is not a rental
Yellow-yellow Lamborghini coupe, this is not a lemon

VVS's bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin' (Queen)

I'm tryna ball, I just copped me some hoops
Blonde on my inches, brown on the roots
Can-candy apple sticky, red Bach, not the fruit
Co-copped me them cute double C's on my boot (Ah)
I'ma lil' busy, go shoppin' 'til I finish
Send-send me with an AMEX, I don't need a limit
Every-every bit of seven hundred, this is not a rental
Yellow-yellow Lamborghini coupe, this is not a lemon
I fuck him like a boss, Dolce Gabbana scarf
Burberry, ask Siri, I don't ever take a loss
Big whips, I like his drip, big stick, a hundred clips
If it's givin' what it's 'posed to, I might put it on the lip (Woo)

VVS's bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin'
VVS's bu-bu-bussin'
Ass so fat, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Bag so full, it's bu-bu-bussin'
Drivin' foreigns, bitches bussin' (Queen)37Embed
