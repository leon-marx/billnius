You got a new life
Am I bothering you? Do you wanna talk?
We share the last line
Then we drink the wall till we wanna talk

I go 'round and 'round
Satellite

Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya

I'm in an L.A. mood
I don't wanna talk to you
She said, "Give me a day or two"

I go 'round and 'round
Satellite

Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya to pull me in
I can see you're lonely down there
Don't you know that I am right here?
Right here, right here
Spinnin' out, waitin' for ya
I'm here, right here
Wishin' I could be there for ya
Be there for ya
Be there for ya, for ya
For ya
Be there for ya
