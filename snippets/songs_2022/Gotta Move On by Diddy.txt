Gotta Move On Lyrics
She don't want it, she dont want it
She don't want it, she don't want it
Get in your bag, stay in your bag (She dont want it)
Get in your bag, stay in your bag  (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

She don't want my love, I guess I gotta move on
Yeah, oh yeah (Oh yeah), oh yeah (Oh nah, woah)
Oh but, if she don't want my love, I guess I gotta move on
Oh yeah, yeah, oh yeah, oh no (Come on)
If she don't want my love, I'm guessin' I gotta move on, I guess
I guess, I guess, I came a little too strong, I guess
She don't want my love, I guess I gotta move on
I guess (Gotta mov on)
(Move on, move on, move on)
I trid, I tried to give it all to you, baby
Brand new Mercedes, a newborn baby, yeah
And I told you, "Your love too lazy," damn
All you had to do was love me, baby, yeah
And it gets so frustrating, yeah
Why you wanna go and test me, baby? Yeah
Degrade me and tell me I'm failing, yeah
Keep tellin me things like
You done tryin with me, done fightin' with me, yeah
Gave you a ring, I was goin off the deep end, yeah
On DeLeon, my drink for the weekend
Sent you some things, yeah, when I was done drinkin', like
"Girl, he with you for the wrong reasons 'cause you was with me"
Uh, tell him, "Stop reachin'" (Stop reachin)
Guess that's just the jealous in me
I'm salty and needy, and my wounds keep bleeding
You found a new man, so I gotta move on
Guess you got a new agenda with someone you barely know, I won't
Said you're wrong, guess you had to move on
On, on, on, on, said she

If she don't want my love, I'm guessin' I gotta move on, I guess
I guess, I guess, I came a little too strong, I guess
She don't want my love, I guess I gotta move on
I guess (Gotta move on)
Yeah
I guess I gotta move on, I guess

We goin' up, we goin' live
Can't stop, won't stop, told y'all, uh
See me pull up, no problem (Wash it)
I can never ever be no one option (Watch it)
Pull up on me but no blogs (No blogs)
Now you wanna say you wanna talk (Wanna talk)
Now you wanna say you wanna talk (Wanna talk)
Now you wanna say you wanna, hol' up
Stay in your bag, stay in your bag
Get in your bag, stay in your bag (Yeah, that's right)
Get in your bag, stay in your bag (Ooh yeah)
Get in your bag, stay in your bag

Gotta move on
Find peace
