Babe
Girl, you psychic, psychic
Don't be lookin' at me sideways, sideways
Girl, you psychic, psychic
Oh-oh
Sexy, sexy
It's your life, your way
I know you psychic, psychic
Stop lookin' at me sideways
'Cause I wanna
I wanna know how she know (Me)
And how she readin' my mind (She)
She catch me every time
She might be psychic (Yeah)
But I like it
She know about them other girls (The freaks)
But she's still on my mind (For weeks)
Her third eye's always on me
Might be psychic (Yeah)
But I like it, yeah

Loosen up (Swear)
Baby, you're a dim, can you choose me up? (Yeah)
You know I'm not with all of th goofy stuff (Stupid)
No rush, don't confuse yourself
I told you plenty times, I been through some stuff
A lot on my mind, yeah, time's get rough
You give me a sign, now let me up, up high
I got the keys in the trunk (Yeah, yeah)
If it come down to it, would you lie for me? (Yeah, yeah)
Put your life on the line, cry for me? (For me)
All I'm askin' from you is a little loyalty
All I'm askin' from you is a little loyalty, yeah-yeah

I wanna know how she know (Me)
And how she readin' my mind (She)
She catch me every time

But I like it
She know about them other girls (The freaks, oh)
But she's still on my mind (For weeks, yeah)
Her third eye's always on me
Might be psychic (Yeah)
But I like it, yeah

I know it's late, but there's so much I could offer you
I know you can't get these party promoters off of you
But tell me, would you slide for me if I called for you?
Hop in the shower, let me wash that club off of you
And I got some Colgate for that Casamigos
I know that tequila aggravate your alter ego
And that little body that you got is like a cheat code
You a sweetheart, but I know that you a freak though (Freak though)
I know you at the club sippin' Clicquot
Rappin' to that Durkio, but you know I know that you a geek though
I know that you watch anime, I know you'd rather be home
I know you had a emo phase and you had a ringtone
That went like, "You've been waiting so long"
Yes, I have and I'm growin' impatient
Growin' up, I used to go in the basement
Now I'm grown and we on the top floor, it's amazin'
The penthouse, NASA, I'll show you what space is
First, second, third, I could show you the bases
I don't have to say shit 'cause I feel like you know what I'm thinkin'
I wanna know how she know (Me)
And how she readin' my mind (She)
She catch me every time
She might be psychic (Might be, yeah)
But I like it
She know about them other girls (The freaks, she knows about them girls)
But she's still on my mind (For weeks, always on my mind)
Her third eye's always on me (Ooh)
Might be psychic (Yeah)
But I like it, yeah (Oh-woah)

Shawty psychic, she sideways
Shawty lookin' so good, she my taste
Make me feel so good in every way
You keep readin' my mind, baby, so I hope you understand
Girl, you're psychic, psychic (Woo)
Girl, you're lookin' so good, you're my taste (Woo)
She make me feel so good in every way
Stop lookin' at me sideways, girl, 'cause I know you understand me

I wanna know how she know (Me)
And how she readin' my mind (She)
She catch me every time
She might be psychic (Yeah)
But I like it
She know about them other girls (The freaks)
But she's still on my mind (For weeks)
Her third eye's always on me (Might be)
Might be psychic (Yeah)
But I like it, yeah

You've been waiting so long
Been waiting so
You've been waiting so long
Been waiting so
You've been waiting so long, I'm here to answer your callEmbed
