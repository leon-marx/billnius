I know that you're hiding something from me
That's been close to your heart
And I felt it creepin' up every day
Baby, right from the start
I know that look you give when we're fighting (Fighting)
We're fighting (Fighting)
'Cause I used to be the one who was lying (Lying)
Oh, lying (Lying)

Oh, is there someone else or not?
'Cause I wanna keep you close
I don't wanna lose my spot
'Cause I need to know
If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
Is there someone else or not?
Ooh, or not?
I don't deserv someone loyal to me
Don't you think I see?
And I don't want to b a prisoner to who I used to be
I swear I changed my ways for the better, the better
'Cause I wanna be with you forever, forever

Oh, is there someone else or not?
'Cause I wanna keep you close
I don't wanna lose my spot
'Cause I need to know
If you're hurting him, or you're hurting me
If I ain't with you, I don't wanna be
Is there someone else or not?
Ooh, or not?You might also like49Embed
