Forever Lyrics
(WeMakeBangerz)
(Young Yanabu on the beat)
(JBFlyBoi, oh baby)

All alone on my darkest nights
Tryna make it through my hardest times
Wherever you are tonight
I hope you know you'll have my heart for life
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
Tell me, how you believe in something that you've never seen?
Is true love real or is it make believe?
Gave you my heart with a set of keys
Told me you'll never leave, now you want me to set you free (Yeah)
Took a while to begin, now I know where to start (Yeah)
Really my best friend, always had my heart
Everything feel so wrong whenever we get apart
Every time we together alone, we see shooting stars
'Member when we first found love on the road?
My number one fan, there for all of my shows
In the studio with me all night along, watchin' me achieve my goals
Fuck all these hoes and fuck all this money
Miss the old days back when we was youngins
Way before this drivin' on the cold Decembers
It was me and you against the world, I remember
Was only nineteen when we moved to Atlanta
Way before the fortune, the fame, and the glamour
Couldn't get it right, no, I stayed in my feelings
'Cause you made mistakes, but I made a million
Often forgettin' that we was still young
Through the fussin' and the fightin' it was still love
Never seen nothin' like it, it was real love (It was real love)
But now

All alone on my darkest nights
Tryna make it through my hardest times
Wherever you are tonight
I hope you know you'll have my heart for life
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
All alone on my darkest nights
Tryna make it through my hardest times
Wherever you are tonight
I hope you know you'll have my heart for life
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever and ever
Forever and ever, forever and ever
