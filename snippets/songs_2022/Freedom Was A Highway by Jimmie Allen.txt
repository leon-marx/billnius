Freedom Was A Highway Lyrics
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, woo)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Sunset through a windshield, I can see it now
Like a picture in a frame (Picture in a frame)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Blue jeans and t-shirts, who we were
We wore it like a name (Like a name)
I wish I could go back to those days
When the town was the whole world
And love was the girl next door
Soundtrack was a song in the dark
I miss those days when our dreams
Were there for chasin'
But time was better wasted
We were summer young and livin' for a Friday
And freedom was a highway (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Freedom was a highway (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

Barbwire on a fencepost with a crosswind
On a road no one was on (No one was on)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Five deep with our hands up
Just singin' along to a hip-hop song
I wish I could rewind and replay

When the town was the whole world
And love was the girl next door
Soundtrack was a song in the dark
I miss those days when our dreams
Were there for chasin'
But time was better wasted
We were summer young and livin' for a Friday
And freedom was a highway
Freedom was a highway
You might also like
When you're seventeen and drivin'
You don't think about the road runnin' out
No, no, no, no
You just keep your eyes on that horizon
'Cause you're wrapped up in now (Ooh, ooh)
Hey (Ooh, yeah)
(Ooh, yeah, woo)


I wish I could go back to those days

When the town was the whole world
And love was the girl next door
Soundtrack was a song in the dark
I miss those days when our dreams
Were there for chasin'
But time was better wasted
We were summer young and livin' for a Friday
And freedom was a highway (Freedom was a highway)
Freedom was a highway, baby (Oh, yeah)

And freedom was a highway (Freedom was a highway)
Freedom was a highway (Oh-oh, oh-oh)Embed
