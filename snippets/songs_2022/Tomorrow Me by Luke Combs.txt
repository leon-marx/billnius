Tomorrow Me Lyrics
Telephone rings, can I come over?
It's kinda just the way things go since we've been over
I know what you want, and I want it, too
The problem is what's wrong with it's the bigger issue

Tomorrow me ain't gonna like the way things go tonight
If I let you in and think that it'll be different this time
So maybe we should let yesterday be
'Cause I gotta live with tomorrow me
In morning light, I'll be the guy
Starin' down "I told ya so" for the hundredth time
And you'll be okay, you always are
And I'll be picking up the pieces if we go that far

'Cause tomorrow me ain't gonna like the way things go tonight
If I let you in and think that it'll be different this time
So maybe we should let yesterday be
'Cause I gotta live with tomorrow me

I know how it's gonna end
Just like it always ends

Yeah, tomorrow me ain't gonna like the way things go tonight
If I let you in and think that it'll be different this time
So maybe we should let yesterday be
Yeah, maybe we should let yesterday be
'Cause I gotta live with tomorrow meYou might also likeEmbed
