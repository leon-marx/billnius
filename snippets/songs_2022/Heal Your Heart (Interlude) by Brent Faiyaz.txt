TranslationsPortuguesHEAL YOUR HEART (INTERLUDE) Lyrics
I was outside every day, tryna make it home to you baby
When I get on it's gon be amazing, when we get it on it's amazing
Let's talk about us, if you'll hear me out
They only love me cause they see me getting money now
Fuck the whole front row at the show if you ain't there

Don't nobody got you like I do
Can't nobody patch you up like new
I know your flaws, I know what makes you who you are, girl
I wish I had all the answers to heal your heartYou might also like2Embed
