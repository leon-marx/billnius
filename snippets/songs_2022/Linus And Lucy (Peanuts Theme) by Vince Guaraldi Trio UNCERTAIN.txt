Charlie Brown Lyrics
Pull away the football, I hurt myself
Like Charlie Brown, but we are something else
I will tell you who we are in two parts
None of them will break your hearts
This is all about when I was yea big
There were some points where I couldn't even say shit
That is who I was ever since I made it
Im sure the peanuts is every kid's favorite

I got a story on me, I'm about to show you
I was born on the date of November 8th 02
Family of fiv, Im a middle child
It's been years and years
How wild
Whil growing up I had fights with my sister
Linus and Lucy pretending to be resisters
We also played a lot so it's not all bad
That what made us who we are
I said I saw that
We don't always get along, but we try to work it
I had time outs for my fuck ups, my parents try to search it
Cause I can't be like that in the way future
I now listen to Harlow, he's out there getting cuter
I am very close to my younger sibling
They are my supporter which got me giggling
Cause we care about each other, I'm not even kidding
If I wasn't kidding bout that we would be forbidden
Every day we talk
Once in a while we get a shock
Uh, locked the lock
No anger out of a sock
I get help and they get help, just like a teacher
Even when I was young I acted like a preacher
We be around for each other
Including my father and mother
Im the first and last brother
All a family no cutters
Getting it undercover
Seeing the true colors
I could not wait to get older to see what I discover
Pull away the football, I hurt myself
Like Charlie Brown, but we are something else
I will tell you who we are in two parts
None of them will break your hearts
This is all about when I was yea big
There were some points where I couldnt even say shit
That is who I was ever since I made it
I'm sure the peanuts is every kids favorite

Me and Charlie Brown have similar personalities
We also have similar lives
I grew up watching the peanuts
I loved it and still love it today
I think we are similar characteristically

Me and Charlie Brown
I see us as determined
If you watched the show before you will see that it confirmed it
I can be happy when something comes up
I can be sad, that's concerning
I get sensitive sometimes, but I am reassuring
I didn't understand a lot when my parents talked to me
Sounded like they mumbled words a lot to me
Like the unseen people in the peanuts that try to walk with me
And carry me around so I don't fall on my knees
I had shit I wanted that didnt go in my direction
Cause I gave out a command that would've been my perfection
Kinda like when Charlie and his friends went to a library
Snoopy made a lot of noise and got kicked out fairly
Anytime I wanted a thing done no one would listen
And I would get upset and throw tantrums like I was missing
But I'll stop that shit and go fishing
I catch what's out there and bring it closer to my vision
I hold hands, you can call me a sly dog
Turn the lights off, demons I will fight off
If I was allowed too, I would take the night off
Cause there are points where I think life's gone
Or the end of the world because that's how I felt like
What I been told is that I need to get myself by
Friends and family, they go left and right
Charlie Brown, Lucy, Sally, everyone's the best right?
Yes indeed we are, we have the best life
But different friends and families are less like us
So wish us all luck
We will always and always will give a fuck
