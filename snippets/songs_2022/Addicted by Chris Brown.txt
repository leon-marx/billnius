TranslationsPortuguesAddicted Lyrics
She pretty wit' it
Got a few problems but it's alright 'cause she been dealin' wit' 'em
Sometimes she come and stay overnight, but she ain't livin' wit' 'em
Fuck on somebody from time to time, but she ain't got no nigga
Her last encounter was kinda rough, he made her cry a river
I'll buy you bags from across the globe and get 'em hand-delivered
Get in your mind, you don't even know me, I ain't playin' wit' ya
I'm bein' honest, I'm really him, I ain't gotta lie to kick it
Just come and vibe with me and see if I'm different
Take you out to lunch, I rent the restaurant out
Bitches lyin' on my name, they doin' anythin' for clout
I be wanna take it down, but all these millions keep me grounded
You can play around, but just don't overstep your boundaries
Gave you a workout, have you burnin' calories
I'm tryna please you, just lay on your back for me
Then I'm gon' need you to put on a act for me
It's just somethin' 'bout the way you look in lingerie
And I can't let you run away, girl, you not Coi Leray
I'll give you racks every occasion, put it in your savings
I'll call you back, if I don't answer, don't start actin' crazy
You can do everything I ask you, we might have a baby
And I don't trust no one
I done been scarred, that's just some shit I gotta work on
You ain't gotta like it, I'm tellin' it how it is
How I'm 'posed to know how you feelin' if you don't tell me?
And I ain't tryna hold no one down, I give 'em some leverage
I'll make sure everybody eat, I ain't never been selfish
I'll make sure everybody eat, I ain't never been selfish
I made a promise to your body I'ma stand on, ooh, I
Put your panties over there, don't wanna step on 'em
You know why
'Cause I'm addicted to it
Especially when you take it off now, baby
Fuckin' me, breakin' me off now, baby (Woo)
So deep in it that I'm lost, oh, baby
Fuck it, don't care what it cost, no, baby

What it cost now, baby? Comin' or not?
Chains, Plain Jane in the Cullinan drop
I'm waitin' to hear you say if you love me or not
Look me in my face so I can tell if you lyin'
This ain't no dance song
Put your panties over there, don't wanna step on 'em
'Cause you know why
'Cause I'm addicted to it

I pulled up lookin' like a dive thief
If I see my ex, she gon' be salty (Yee)
Barbie, pop me a X, I'm feelin' godly (Ayy)
She high off Whitney and Bobby, it's a party
Naughty, and girl, you know what I'm into
Bonnie, fuckin' with Clyde, I caught a body
Bad bitch, thick in the thighs, met in the lobby (Yee)
Savage, she pop that pussy like it's a Tommy
Bring it over here 'cause you know what I'm into
All my baddies with no baggage, where you at? Where you at?
Let me holler at you, baby, from the back, from the back
If you fuckin' with me, baby, tell me that, tell me that
I want you
You might also like
I made a promise to your body I'ma stand on, ooh, I (Oh-oh)
Put your panties over there, don't wanna step on 'em
You know why
'Cause I'm addicted to it
Especially when you take it off now, baby (Woo)
Fuckin' me, breakin' me off now, baby
So deep in it that I'm lost, oh, baby
Fuck it, don't care what it cost, no, baby

What it cost now, baby? (Yeah) Comin' or not?
Chains, Plain Jane in the Cullinan drop (Drop)
I'm waitin' to hear you say if you love me or not
Look me in my face so I can tell if you lyin' (Woah-oh, yeah, yee)
This ain't no dance song (Oh, no)
Put your panties over there, don't wanna step on 'em
'Cause you know why
'Cause I'm addicted to itEmbed
