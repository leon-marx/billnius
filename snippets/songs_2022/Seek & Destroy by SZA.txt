TranslationsEspanolPortuguesItalianoSeek & Destroy Lyrics
You push me past my own capacity, boy
Permission to crash, collectin' damages, boy
No reachin' or grabbin' for more clarity now
Seek and destroy, all missiles deployed

Do it to you
Do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you
Do it to you
I hate to do it to you, oh
Do what I gotta do, oh
I can't stand it, the urge
Is so demandin', the purge
So necessary, the art of war
Goddamn it, I'm drained
Now that I've ruined everything, I cannot complain
Now that I've ruined everything, I'm so fuckin' free
Now that I've ruined everything, keep it all for me
Now that I've ruined everything, space is all I need

Do it to you
Do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you
Do it to you
I hate to do it to you, oh
Do what I gotta do, oh

Chasin' fatter ass and fake connections
Chasin' facades in all directions
Chances are I've got no direction
Beggin' my angels for protection (Do it to you, oh)
Danger arise and I deflect it
New dick arrives and I erect it
Beggin' my angels for protection
Thankin' my stars, livin' reckless, oh
You might also like
Do it to you
Do it to you
I had to do it to you
Do it to you, oh
Don't make me do it to you
Do it to you
Do it to you
I hate to do it to you, oh
Do what I gotta do, oh

All the pain I know
Is used to fuel my soul
No control
I do it to you, do it to you, uh
All the hurt I know
Is used to heal my soul
No control
I do it to you, do it to you, oh5Embed
