TranslationsEspanolPortuguesF2F Lyrics
I been thinkin' 'bout you, haven't got much sleep
Worried that you already done replaced me
Worried I done took it too far and you too hurt to hear me
Smokin' on a Backwood 'cause I miss my ex
Now I'm ovulatin' and I need rough sex
Knowin' you gon' block me tomorrow, can you still come and get me?

Missin' my daddy when the nights get cold
Wishin' I didn't wanna sell my soul
Wishin' that it wasn't so hard, man, I'm on my knees
Get a rise out of watchin' you fall
Get a kick out of missin' your call
I hate me enough for the two of us
Hate that I can't let go of you enough, this why
I fuck him 'cause I miss you
I fuck him 'cause I really miss you
I fuck him 'cause I miss you

I just had to get my rocks off
You got no loyalty, you push me 'til I pop off
I beg for empathy, you gave me nothing
So hard without you (So hard without you)
I feel it coming, you gon' find anothr one
To keep you calm and tuck you in at night, I wonder
Will you call me? Will you hang m out to dry?

Missin' my daddy when the nights get cold
Wishin' I didn't wanna sell my soul
Wishin' that it wasn't so hard, man, I'm on my knees

Get a rise out of watchin' you fall
Get a kick out of missin' your call
I hate me enough for the two of us
Hate that I can't let go of you enough, this why
I fuck him 'cause I miss you
I fuck him 'cause I really miss you
I fuck him 'cause I miss you
You might also like
I'm lookin' for comfort, I knew all along
I knew that you loved her, since we droppin' bombs
I fuck him 'cause I miss you
I fuck him 'cause I really miss you
I fuck him to forget you
I fuck him 'cause I miss you
I fuck him 'cause I miss you
I try to run, but I don't block 'em
Fuck 'em, but I don't cuff 'em
I fuck 'em 'cause I miss you3Embed
