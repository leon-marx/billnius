TranslationsItalianoTurkceEspanolFrancaisReputation Lyrics
Take my own life just to save yours
Drink it all down just to throw it up
Take my own life just to save yours (Just to save yours)
Take my own life just to save yours
I got a reputation that I can't deny
You're the superstar, entertain us (Entertain us)

Entertain us, but please, don't wake me up
I betrayed us, but us don't give a fuck
Kill myself today, kill it all away
Broken path I made
Please, just stay away
I know I fucked up before, but I won't do it again
And I got a lot of things that I wish I would've said
And I'm the same damn fool, and I'm wearin' that hat again
I know I fucked up and I can't make it right

Watch yourself, I can't slow down
This is who I am, can't be anyon else, so
Don't let m go, save yourself
Just save yourself, just save yourself
I was born to raise hell, I was born to take pills
I was born to chase mills, I was born to cave in
I was born to fuck hoes, I was born to fuck up
I was born, what a shame

Take my own life just to save yours
Drink it all down just to throw it up
Take my own life just to save yours (Just to save yours)
Take my own life just to save yours
I got a reputation that I can't deny
You're the superstar, entertain us (Entertain us)

Cut my thumb up
Count my check, count my check
Let me choke on my cigarettes, cigarettes
Cut my thumb up
Count my check, count my check
Let me choke on my cigarettes and heavy debtYou might also like21Embed
