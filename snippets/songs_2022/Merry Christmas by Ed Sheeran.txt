TranslationsEnglishDeutschMerry Christmas Lyrics
Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me

So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all
Spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
Merry Christmas, everyone

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

So just keep kissin' me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look beautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

I feel it when it comes
Every year helpin' us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All our family and friends
Are together where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone

It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas time4Embed
