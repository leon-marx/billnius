TranslationsPortuguesCloser Lyrics
Hold me closer
It's the freak in me, I wanna show ya
It feels so good, don't want it to be over
And I ride it, I know that you like it
Come closer, it's the freak in me

I want you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
I do anything for you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
It's the freak in me, I want
I wanna fall in love for the weekend
Three boyfriends, I don't know where I'm sleepin' (Uh-huh)
We be clubbin', thuggin', fuckin'
Order room service when we done, that's the sequence
He know I'm a classy nympho
Keep it simpl, you know what you here for
Tell th concierge let you up with the key code
All his ice on but he 'bout to catch a heat stroke
You got everything that I like
You don't eat the booty, you lyin'
Caught you mixing liquors, you might
Hold me tight and pull me

Hold me closer
It's the freak in me, I wanna show ya
It feels so good, don't want it to be over
And I ride it, I know that you like it
Come closer, it's the freak in me

I want you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
I do anything for you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do
It's the freak in me, I want

Want a quickie in my rose on my Hermes leather
No shoes in my car 'cause my floor mats feather
Ain't trippin' if it rain 'cause it came with umbrellas, it get wetter
I got 'em sending Birkins on my birthday
I ain't never met him, he don't even know my birth name
Liking all my pics, so I know he like 'em curvy
Crush on a it boy, want him in the worst way
I just roll the dice, only store him under nick names
Icy, muah, ooh, la-la (Icy)
Take them eight inch out them drawers
Da Vinci dick, come paint these walls
Hold me closer, ooh, ce soir

Hold me closer (Closer)
It's the freak in me, I wanna show ya (Let me show ya, babe)
It feels so good, don't want it to be over
And I ride it, I know that you like it
Come closer, it's the freak in me

I want you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do (Everything you do)
I do anything for you, you, you
I love everything you do, do, do (Yeah, I do, baby)
It's the freak in me, I want3Embed
