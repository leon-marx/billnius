Top Sound Lyrics
(Pipe that shit up, TNT)
(Khris James, what the fuck?)
My sound rude boy sound (Ah-da-da-da)
My sound (Ah-da-da-da)
My sound jungle sound (Ayy)

In my town, it ain't calm, it's too real
Out at night, protect your life when in the field, get hit with that steel
Gun sounds in my grandma house, I hear 'em all night
Mind your business, stay up out my life
They ain't gangster, they be tellin' lies
My sound, it's from the town
My sound make the pros gather 'round
My sound no playin' with sound
My sound kill, kill sound

Shit, what it is? I'm out my mind, I got your son bangin' slime
Who left him dead up inside the neighborhood? That was I
Don't cross that line, respect my mind, bitch, I'm gon' hit you with that iron
I'm a grimy motherfucker, tell them Trinidad my kind
Shit, look, we bang too, what it is you wanna do?
Oh, you wanna try mine? We gon' slump you
And then flex on you bitches like Big Dump do
I don't dance, I just bop, you gotta watch inside the party
She wanna fuck, let me record it
My music make her act retarded, slime

My sound, it's from the town
My sound make the pros gather 'round
My sound no playin' with sound
My sound kill, kill sound

My sound rude boy sound
My sound (Real deal sound)
My sound jungle sound
My sound jungle sound
My sound
My soundYou might also likeEmbed
