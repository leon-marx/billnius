Flossin Lyrics
Ridin' in a Maybach flossin
Shawty with me wonder why I get her often
High as hell, don't wan do no talkin'
And tell them niggas that they better approach with caution

Hold that love around me, this shit bring hatred out me
Scarred from love, on these drugs, got my world cloudy
I was hiding in my big home, dont know how they found me
Northside with my thugs
Get hit with slugs you pull up where them rounds be
Black ops all we got out here
Strapped with chrome, got Polo on
These diamonds hit like chandeliers
Hol' on, jack some stores, don't play on phones
It can turn out soon as that first call in
I just spotted on, now I'm on a dome
Cop my lens as soon as I first walked in
I won't feel a thing for th night out
Please don't hold no grudge against me
I'll be gone 'fore the lights out
Can you tell me right now? (Right now)
If it come down to them all going against me
Just wanna know you got my back, thats all
Public try to take pictures, I dont take interest, no
Get into it, don't wanna talk to you til my feelings gone
Niggas wanna put me up
But I been down, since my friend been gone
My brother, my thug, who got me though?
Hope ones who I had all along
Ridin' in a Maybach flossin'
Shawty with me wonder why I get her often
High as hell, don't wan do no talkin'
And tell them niggas that they better approach with caution

They better proceed with caution
These diamonds ain't coming up off me
Nigga know I tote big .40's, pull up and end your party
I say I can't keep these bitches off me
See them gunners, they still ain't caught me
Catch you round just for to find peace
But you done linked to what the blogs see
They know what up, ain't none for to talk 'bout shit
Come pull up, nigga
Big sticks inside this truck, ain't gotta work out
If I up, like a pull up nigga
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven figures
Two, four, six came, I zipped seven niggas
Hatchback liftin' up the fender
Compete, defeat, kill all contenders, where my pole?

I can't die, you know these niggas they might try, ooh
So just like God, I keep my fire right by my side, yeah
I'm driving fast, happy I'm up, I ain't suicidal, at least right now
Still gettin it in, free them gang babies, need 'em on side me (My Slime)
