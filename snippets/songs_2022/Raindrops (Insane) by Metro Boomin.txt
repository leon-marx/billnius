(Metro)

Drop top in rain, this night feel insane
I'm up dodgin' raindrops, on road in this Range (Rain, rain)
Double cup this pain, I'm fucked up, I can't aim
Triple cups of anger, I can't hold this in
I throw it, recoup it, I got a check, I just had to do it
I mix up the jazz, I rhythm and blues it
It make you crash when you goin' through it
Pill pop the pain (Yeah), piss purple rain
Do this again, hilltop, Skylaning (It's lit)
You get chills, that's alright
You stayed down, down for life
Out the field, in the wild
Up my hill, it's a mile
You come still with a smile
I ain't feel in a while
New AP, no Timex (Ayy, ayy)
I'm right now and I'm next (Oh)
Put the whole game on my neck (Ooh)
I run it up hills and chiropractor bills
You should charge mills
Wherever I reside, it's quiet (Shh)
Private (Shh), silence (Shh)
But every time, 9 PM, it's high-pitched (It's lit)
12 o'clock (Lit), riot

Drop top in rain (Yeah), this night feel insane
I'm up dodgin' raindrops, on road in this Range (It's lit)
Double cup this pain, I'm fucked up, I can't aim (Straight up)
Triple cups of anger, I can't hold this in (Ooh)
I throw it, recoup it, I got a check, I just had to do it
I mix up the jazz, I rhythm and blues it
It make you crash when you goin' through it
Pill pop the pain (Yeah), piss purple rain
Do this again, hilltop, Skylaning (It's lit)

When it kick back, got some recoil
Had to run it back, made a sequel
Way she did that, it can't be legal
Now she feelin' heiress, feelin' regal
Snuck the whole bird in the seagull
Dirty got me good, feelin' evil
Darkskin chick in the daytime (Ooh)
She turn off the news and give me headlines
Put it in their name, they're dodgin' fed time
Stash it in they face, somewhere they can't find
I'm wrappin' up the crib with the Grape Vines
Don't care 'bout what you heard through the grapevine
I'ma be the man, but I'm the mankind
You might feel insane but I'm insaner

Drop top in rain, this night feel insane
I'm up dodgin' raindrops, on road in this Range (Rain, rain)
Double cup this pain, I'm fucked up, I can't aim
Triple cups of anger, I can't hold this in (Skrrt)
I throw it, recoup it, I got a check, I just had to do it
I mix up the jazz, I rhythm and blues it
It make you crash when you goin' through it
Pill pop the pain (Yeah), piss purple rain
Do this again, hilltop, Skylaning (It's lit)
