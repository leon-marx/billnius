Romantic Homicide Lyrics
I'm scared (Oh-oh-oh)
It feels like you don't care (Ooh-ooh)
Enlighten me, my dear  (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Why am I still here? Mm (Oh-oh)
I don't mean to be
Complacent with the decisions you made
But why? Mm

In the back of my mind
You died
And I didn't even cry
No, not a single tear
And I'm sick of waiting patiently
For someone that won't even arrive
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

In the back of my mind
I killed you
And I didn't even regret it
I can't believe I said it
But it's true
I hate youYou might also like8Embed
