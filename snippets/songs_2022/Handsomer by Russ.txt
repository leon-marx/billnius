HANDSOMER Lyrics
I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up in the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up in the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
Balenciaga slides so she slidin'
She said it's 'cause the vibe, mmmm, she lyin'
We both know that I'm a walkin' lick (Lick)
Why you think she all up on my dick? (Dick)
It's cool though, I ain't mad at ya, I let her go like Passenger
You slept on me like lavender, my body like a map
Your tongue just turn into a traveler, you started throwing ass
You think that I'ma throw some cash on you
But I'm just clappin' you, I know what's up

I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up in the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up in the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine

The possibility of paper
Got her tryin' to tell me I should date her (Date her)
She just tryin' to play me, I just play it cool then I play her (Play her)
Baby hate the game, not the player (Player)
I'm 5'6 but the money make me 6'5
She said "I love your songs" I told her to list 5
I'm 5'6 but the money make me 6'5
She said "I love your songs" I told her to list 5

I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up in the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine
But the money makes me handsomer
Walk around, smelling like a come-up in the answer for her
Problems but I'm not him, I don't mind it though
You don't like me how you think you do, I like it though
I know I'm fine1Embed
