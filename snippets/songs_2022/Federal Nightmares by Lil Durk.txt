TranslationsEspanolFederal Nightmares Lyrics
Tahj Money
Feel like I don't be havin' nobody to vent to
So I come to the studio, I'm just
Talkin' my thoughts (TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

Delete my iCloud if I think they really on me, though
When trial come, it ain't your phone, it be your homie, though
He on the stand with his head down like he don't know me, though
It ain't no point in no gettin' lawyer if your homie told
He was with you on them late nights and them fast cars and them ski masks
If you mad, then I'm mad, then he mad, then he glad
Incredible witness, got every code to my keypad
Couldn't hold it down, nigga jumped right off the deep end
Now I'm havin' federal nightmares
I'm havin' federal nightmares
Havin' federal nightmares
I'm havin' federal nightmares

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no

They love you, then when you get booked, then it's fuck you
Mama need half on rent, they treat her like she nothin'
That gang shit be cool, in reality it ain't nothin'
They know she hold you down, but your dog will still fuck her
See, that See, that shit hurt me the worst
And I ain't understand life, so it ain't hurt me at first
And I was tryna buy they loyalty, I was thirsty at first
Even though I'm doin' good, I'm still thirsty for Perc's

Now I'm havin' federal nightmares
I'm havin' federal nightmares
Havin' federal nightmares
I'm havin' federal nightmares

I popped a pill one day and thought about a suicide
I was feeling like nobody really loved me
Like the bitch I loved really tried to dub me
As a kid, a grown lady tried to rub me
I see my niece and tell her her daddy was a rider
Provider, and he advised us to rise up
I can't wife a bitch who ever hit my guys up
I pay two hundred cash for gang every time my bag's up

Now I'm havin' federal nightmares
I'm havin' federal nightmares
Havin' federal nightmares
I'm havin' federal nightmares

No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no1Embed
