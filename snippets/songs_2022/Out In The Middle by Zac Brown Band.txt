Out in the Middle Lyrics
There's an old route two-lane
Taking out past where the radio just can't
Pass a riverbed with a rope swing
And a mailbox painted all John Deere green

The end of a bunch of gravel driveway
Out here doing our own thing

Out in the middle where the hard work meets hard living
Out in the middle where we're grown 'til we're gone, God willing
Just some good old boys and good old girls
Hunting red dirt dreams in a concrete world
Getting by on just a little, out in the middle
Come Friday, we come undone
Stay, have a little like a highlight neon
Barely hanging on like shelving a pole bar
You can hear Hank clear 'cross the next farm

City folks say we're crazy
But they ain't never been way

Out in the middle where the hard work meets hard living
Out in the middle where we're grown 'til we're gone, God willing
Just some good old boys and good old girls
Hunting red dirt dreams in a concrete world
Getting by on just a little

Out in the middle of nowhere, that's where I wanna be
And the old oak shade by the family graves
With the Southern ground all day

Out in the middle where the hard work meets hard living
Out in the middle where we're grown 'til we're gone, God willing
Just some good old boys and good old girls
Hunting red dirt dreams in a concrete world
Getting by on just a little, out in the middleYou might also likeEmbed
