make up sex Lyrics
Okay, screaming when we fuck, screaming when we fight, yeah
Even when I'm drunk, you're my only type, yeah
Please don't break my heart, I know that you might, yeah
Tell me, tell me now, are you 'bout that life? Yeah
Bonnie and Clyde, ready to die
Two gravesites, later tonight
You told me to stop waiting
I can feel your back breaking
Face down, lay pipe, ooh
Waterworks, swim your pool
Backstroke, we both naked
I can see that ass shaking (Damn)
Yeah, break up just to make up (Mak up)
You're gone when I wak up
Yeah, break up just to make up (Make up)
You're gone when I wake up

(Yeah) I love chaos, I love toxic
I love wreckage, I love falling
Pics you're taking, pics you're cropping
It's hard lately, I'm exhausted
You hate my guts then you love me
You make me feel so disgusting
Can't stop a runner from running
So, go, go, go
You're my only drug, you're my only vice, yeah
Fighting then we fuck, you're my only type, yeah
Mixing bad decisions up with one night stands and Hennessey
All I've got's this broken heart but you can have the rest of me

Yeah, break up just to make up (Make up)
You're gone when I wake up
Yeah, break up just to make up (Make up)
You're gone when I wake up
You might also like
When you come back, I'll be waiting (I'm missing you)
There's something you're not saying
When you come back, I'll be waiting (Is it someone new?)
There's something you're not saying

I'm missing you
Is it someone new?8Embed
