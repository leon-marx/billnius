Ooh-ooh

Livin' in a daydream
She said, "Love me like you paid me"
You know Ill be gone for so long
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Ooh-ooh
Stay until the morning
'Cause, baby, lovin' yous the real thing
It just feels right
When you give me all of your love, give me something to dream about
(All of your love, give me something to dream about)
So give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Ooh-ooh
Oh, no

Livin' in a daydream

Give me all of your love, give me something to dream about

Livin' in a daydream
Livin' in a daydream (It's alright)
Livin' in a daydream
