TranslationsTurkceEspanolWrapped Around Your Finger Lyrics
You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth

I cant call you right now, I been drinking
And I know that I'll say what I'm thinking
My whole life I was drawn to the deep end
When will it sink in?
Why do I tell myself that Ill do the best I can?
I know damn well that you couldn't give a damn
Ten billion cuties that think I'm the man
But if you come around, I'll be eatin' out your hand
Keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
I was caught up in your orbit, spinnin' like a bullet
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's th one replacing me?
Tak me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)

When we met, you ain't know I was a singer
You werent impressed by all the ice on my fingers (So icy)
I had your mom and daddys house on my pinky (My pinky)
If I'da known what itd be like now
I wouldn't be in misery right now
Look in the mirror, I don't see myself
Being with me has gotta be like hell
So tell the devil I'ma be right down

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger, I was caught up in your orbit
Spinnin like a bullet (Spinnin' like a bullet)
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's the one replacing me? (Oh)
Take me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
Then was shot back down to Earth (Shot back down to Earth)

Yeah, I'm wrapped around, and around
And around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
You got me wrapped around, and around
And around on your finger now (Ooh, ooh)
I'ma be right down

You keep me wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger, I was caught up in your orbit
Spinnin' like a bullet (Spinnin' like a bullet)
I was wrapped around your finger, wrapped around your finger
Then I shot back down to Earth (Then was shot back down to Earth)
I keep wondering who's the one replacing me?
Take me back to yesterday
When I was wrapped around your finger
Wrapped around your finger
Then was shot back down to Earth14Embed
