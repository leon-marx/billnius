Thinking Bout You Lyrics
Well, look who it is
The last call I thought I'd get
How's your mama, how you've been?
Girl, it's been too long
Saw your sister at the Circle K
Heard baby number two was on the way
Hadn't seen her since her weddin' day
With you on my arm

It's good to hear from you again
Girl, what a coincidence
I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars on a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up right out of the blue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you (Oh)
I was just thinkin' 'bout you (Mmm)

Hey, I just gotta say
I heard your song the other day
And it put a smile on my face
When I started reminiscing

I've been on the edge of callin' you
And I'm so glad I decided to

I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars on a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up right out of the blue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you
You might also like
If you're ever back in town
Do what you're doin' right now
'Cause I'm probably thinkin' 'bout you (Ooh, woah, oh)

I was just thinkin' 'bout that weekend out on Cumberland Lake
And that one time in Baton Rouge when we made out in the rain
Where we went chasin' fallin' stars on a hill at your daddy's farm
Don't be sorry for callin' me up right out of the blue
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you
I was just thinkin' 'bout you
Oh, I was just thinkin' 'bout you1Embed
