Beautiful Lies Lyrics
Oh, oh
Mm, mm
Oh, oh

You had me at hello (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Could never make you happy, girl, it must be the devil (Mm-mm, mm-mm)

Beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Don't break my heart, tell me beautiful lies (Beautiful, mm-mm, mm-mm)
She's an emotional wreck right now (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
She's got some things on her chest right now
I bet she lookin' at my text right now (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
So hit me back, don't do me bad like that
Can't take you back, left you in the past like that
I'm the reason why you been in your bag like that
Don't get this shit confused
You lied to me, I won't believe you again (You lied)
But fuck that shit, you'll never see me again
Came in my life and now you leavin' again (Came in my life and now you leavin' again)
You tellin' me

Beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Don't break my heart, tell me beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Mm, I want to believe you when you say (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
That you always loved me that way
Tell me beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Beautiful lies

What can I say to you?
Hopefully nothing I can't take back
We're gettin' further from the right track
(We're gettin', gettin' further from the right track)
And I'm in this place with you, woah
Where every day it's like you're under attack
And we can't keep gettin' down like that (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
'Cause we be fallin' out, you keep fuckin' up
You apologize and I suck it up
I just stick around, try to toughen up
Is the love enough? You're tellin' me
You might also like
Beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Don't break my heart, tell me beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Mm, I want to believe you when you say
That you always loved me that way
Beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Beautiful lies

Don't wanna see you but I need your love
Had to ice out 'cause they be sleep on us
Lickin' on that thing, you fell deep in love
Baby, come and tell me what you need from love
I'll be here, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm), beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)

You had me at hello (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Could never make you happy, girl, it must be the devil (Mm-mm, mm-mm)

Beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Don't break my heart, tell me beautiful lies (Beautiful, mm-mm, mm-mm)
Mm, I want to believe you when you say
That you always loved me that way
Tell me beautiful lies (Mm-mm, mm-mm)
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm3Embed
