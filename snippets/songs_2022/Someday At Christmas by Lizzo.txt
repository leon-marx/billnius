Someday At Christmas (Amazon Original) Lyrics
Someday at Christmas, men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where we are free, ooh, yeah
Someday at Christmas, there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on Earth, hey!

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where we ar free
Maybe just in time for you and me
Somday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas, we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Woah, someday at Christmas, there'll be no tears
When we all equal and no one has fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

Someday our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where we are free
Maybe just in time for you and me
Someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas we will not fail
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart, woah

Someday all our dreams will come to be (Oh)
Someday in a world where we are free (Someday, we are free)
Maybe just in time for you and me
Someday at Christmas time
