7500 OBO Lyrics
Got an '06, stick shift
Dark blue F150 in good condition
Got a hundred and nineteen thousand miles
Only five on the new transmission

It's got leather seats, a sun roof
It's sittin' on thirty-threes, it runs smooth
It'll get you from A to B, but not for me
'Cause every time I turn that key, I see her
Shotgun ridin' down a two-lane road
Just drivin' around with no place to go, ah
Singin' along to "Where the Green Grass Grows"
Hands out the window, floatin' on the breeze
She's fixin' her lips in the dropdown mirror
That pretty little thing made it hard to steer
I'm never gonna get her out of there
There's too many memories
Now there's a "For sale" sign in the window
Yeah, 'cause if I'm gonna let her go
I gotta let it go, yeah, it's gotta go
So it's $7500 OBO

Back bumper's got a dent from her backin' in
To a mailbox first time she drove it
Couldn't even be mad with her lookin' like that
Told her, "Hell, you can hardly even notice"

It's got nights with her I can't forget
Kissin' on the tailgate of the truck bed
I wish I didn't have to get rid of it
But every time I turn that key, I see her
You might also like
Shotgun ridin' down a two-lane road
Just drivin' around with no place to go, ah
Singin' along to "Where the Green Grass Grows"
Hands out the window, floatin' on the breeze
She's fixin' her lips in the dropdown mirror
That pretty little thing made it hard to steer
I'm never gonna get her out of there
There's too many memories
Now there's a "For sale" sign in the window
Yeah, 'cause if I'm gonna let her go
I gotta let it go, yeah, it's gotta go
So it's $7500 OBO

It's got leather seats, a sun roof
It's sittin' on thirty-threes, it runs smooth
It'll get you from A to B, but not for me
'Cause every time I turn that key, I see her

Shotgun ridin' down a two-lane road
Just drivin' around with no place to go, ah
Singin' along to "Where the Green Grass Grows"
Hands out the window, floatin' on the breeze
She's fixin' her lips in the dropdown mirror
That pretty little thing made it hard to steer
I'm never gonna get her out of there
There's too many memories
Now there's a "For sale" sign in the window
Yeah, 'cause if I'm gonna let her go
I gotta let it go, yeah, it's gotta go
So it's $7500 OBO
It's $7500 OBO
It's $7500 OBOEmbed
