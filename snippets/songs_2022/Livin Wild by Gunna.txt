TranslationsEspanollivin wild Lyrics
(Makers)
(Why, why me, baby?)
You know every day, we livin' life
Up and downs and shit, goin' through shit
Going through changes, and you know what I'm sayin' (Why me, baby?)
Real life shit
(Why, why me, baby?)
(I been livin' wild)
(Why me, baby?)
I just left the hospital, might need another liver
Kidney failures, I tell you this shit couldn't be no realer
My body and drugs too familiar so it's hard to clear my system
This shit get hard on a nigga, I hardly show my feelings
Look up to see stars, but I'm realizing God in the ceiling
I been getting high inconsistent, but you tryna show me different
Judging me for trying the whippets, I'm tired of the critics
But I can't cap, I ain't feel it, but this time I done did it
The doc' didn't care who th richest, I need to be admitted

(I been livin' wild)
(Why m, baby? Why?)

Wanna know why the reason on why I have my reasons?
Reason why they ain't tell me it was pneumonia season
These police won't never save us, that's why I run with heathens
God say you want me to say it, you gotta take it easy
I'm tryna stack it like layers and keep it extra cheesy
I had stepped back from these rappers, these niggas actin' greedy
I'm gon' say no, I don't owe you, don't care if you really need it
Sometimes you gotta show you ain't no ho, ain't talking 'bout no bob and weavin'
Niggas know I got love for PO and Debo, must I repeat it?
(Niggas know I got love for PO and Debo, must I repeat it?)
Wake up, hit the 'yo, spit a flow, say let's go, then I repeat it
Take a look at my bro and I know we gotta eat
You a rockstar lil' soldier, I hope you don't never leave me
Codeine all in your colon, you got that shit and squeeze
Fucked up, can't control it, you steady rollin' weed
Everyone said they told you and you ain't takin' heed
You might also like

(I been livin' wild)
(Why me, baby?)
(Why, why?)
(Why, why me, baby?)
(I been livin' wild)
(Why me, baby?)
(I been livin' wild)

Run that back, Turbo (Why, why me baby?)
(I been livin' wild)
(Why me, baby?)5Embed
