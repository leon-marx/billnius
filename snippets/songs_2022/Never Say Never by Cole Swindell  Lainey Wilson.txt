Never Say Never Lyrics
I told my momma, I told my friends when it comes to her
When it comes to him, never again
Last time was the last time that time, nearly did us in
Yeah, too much drama
Girl, you're a match, you're gasoline
We just burn too fast
So here we are, lightin' up that spark
Yeah, we tried to run but we didn't get far

I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's Hell and it's Heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you
You got a touch that kills me, makes me feel alive
Couldn't turn me off, yeah, even if you tried
So keep turnin' me on and turn out the lights
Who knows tonight, we might get it right

I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's Hell and it's Heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you, yeah
I never say never with you


I never say never with you, I end up together with you
It's Hell and it's Heaven with you, baby
Anything's possible, the highs are unstoppable
It's so uncontrollable, it's crazy
We say we won't and then we do
You're all I want, I never say never with you, yeah
We say we won't, but what's the use?
Baby, come on, I'll never say never with you
Oh, no
You're all I want, I never say never with you
Oh, no, no-no, no-no

I told my momma, I told my friends when it comes to her
When it comes to him, never againEmbed
