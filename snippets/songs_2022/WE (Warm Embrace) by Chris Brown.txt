TranslationsPortuguesWE (Warm Embrace) Lyrics
I can see your mind is overworked, boo (Yeah)
Tension in your body when I touch you (Yeah)
Girl, you deserve it
I'm gon' make every second of this worth it
Love how you do everything you do with a purpose, babe
Focus, babe, oh-oh

Temperature keeps rising like Poseidon when you ride my wave
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Whisper your desires, I'll provide 'em, will you say you'll stay tonight?
'Cause when we done making love, clean it up
And I wanted to wrap you in
My warm embrace
And make it last forever
Girl, I catch a glimpse of heaven
When you let me wrap you in (Wrap you in)
My warm embrace (My warm embrace)
Visions of my hands in places
My warm embrace

Take my chance and dive into your ocean, yeah
Tried my best to give you all that you want
Girl, before you leave, let me love every part of your anatomy
And I want you to pour your pain on me, oh, yeah

Temperature keeps rising like Poseidon when you ride my wave (Ride my wave, oh)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Oh-oh), yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)
Whisper your desires, I'll provide 'em, will you say you'll stay tonight? (Stay)
'Cause when we done making love (When we done), clean it up

And I wanted to wrap you in (Huh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
My warm embrace (My warm, my warm)
And make it last forever
Girl, I catch a glimpse of heaven
When you let me wrap you in (In)
My warm embrace (My warm embrace)
Visions of my hands in places (Yeah)
My warm embrace
You might also like
Let me make it right
Take my time inside
I know you're way past due
Give my all to you (Huh)
Tonight gon' be about you, baby
Give you somethin' that'll drive you crazy
Will you say that you'll stay?
'Cause when we done making love, clean it up

And I wanted to wrap you in (Oh, no-no)
My warm embrace (My warm embrace)
And make it last forever
Girl, I catch a glimpse of heaven (Ooh)
When you let me wrap you in (Let me wrap you in)
My warm embrace (Oh, yeah, da-da-da-da)
Visions of my hands in places
My warm embrace

Wrap you in
My warm embrace
Make it last forever, baby
Uh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
My warm embrace
(My warm embrace, my warm embrace)
(My warm embrace, my warm embrace)5Embed
