TranslationsEnglishPortuguesDeutschBlack Summer Lyrics
A lazy rain am I, the skies refuse to cry
Cremation takes its piece of your supply
The night is dressed like noon, a sailor spoke too soon
And China's on the dark side of the moon
(Hit me now)

Platypus are a few, the secret life of Roo
A personality I never knew (Get it on)
My Greta weighs a ton, the archers on the run
And no one stands alone behind the sun
It's been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on anothr black summer to end
It's been a long time and you nver know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end


Crack the flaming whip, a-sailin' on a censorship
Riding on a headless horse to make the trip

Been a long time since I made a new friend
Waitin' on another black summer to end
It's been a long time and you never know when
Waitin' on another black summer to end

I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to end
I've been waitin', I've been waitin'
Waitin' on another black summer to endYou might also like15Embed
