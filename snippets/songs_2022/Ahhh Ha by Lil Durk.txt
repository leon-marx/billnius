Ayy, this shit like videos, you hear me?
Everything I'm sayin', this motherfucker all props (This shit is not real)
Just case the police listening, you know? (Haha)
Smurk, slide, slide, slide (Man, what?)

Don't respond to shit with Von (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I'm like, fuck it, you tripping, go get your gun (Let's get it, yeah, gun)
They dropping locations, I'm getting it done (Woo, woo, woo, gang)
Fuck tweeting, we sliding, the feds will come (Yeah, yeah, yeah, man, what?)
He fucking his bitches (Bitches), them niggas (Niggas) his sons (Let's get it)
I'm hanging with killers, we breaking a bond (Yeah, yeah, yeah, bond)
They really don't mean it, he say it in songs (Yeah, mean it, say it in songs)
They really don't mean it, he play it in songs (Bitch, yeah)
We been sliding through they blocks and they don't know we have
Buddy ass got shot and we ain't claim it but I can show his ass (Brrah)
Niggas acting like they really like that since my brodie died (Von)
Just got out the feds, you bring up murders with your police ass (Pussy)
I told Von to leave that bitch alone, she post on OnlyFans (Yeah, eater)
Catch 'em at apartments, they been in 'cause that's our only chance (Brrah)
They don't be outside like you think, they ass be on the 'Gram (On gang)
Old opps fucking with my new opps (Brr), oh, man (Brrah)
That shit merched, we been through there, that shit like ghost land (Skrrt, skrrt)
My brother DThang just got killed and I been slow since (Gang, gang, gang)
But we got back on they ass, I bet they know this (Brrah)
And, on bro, I'm speaking facts, this ain't no diss (This ain't no diss)
Keep the police out my business, we don't post shit (We don't post shit)

For school, he save no pen, he'd rather carry him a gen (Five)
A ten (Ten), FN ('N), Perc' 10, I'm saying, he spinning (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You need a pill to slide, he off all 'em milligrams, he been a fan (Bitch)
I seen niggas really killing shit, post shit on Instagram (Pussy)
You doing that, you might as well go to court and say you killed the man
I don't claim niggas who be with opps, I try to reel 'em in (Grrah)
The trenches like a sport, you grab that ball and turn a killer, man (Pussy)
Switches on me, all faceshots, we changing dental plans (Brrah)
All fast cars, make it skrrt, we don't do rental vans (Skrrt)
I can have your homie set you up, his ass a middleman (Ah, ha)
