TranslationsTurkceEspanolI Cannot Be (A Sadder Song) Lyrics
Oh, oh, oh, mmm

How am I free when you hold me so tight?
How can I beam when you blocking my light?
I cannot be what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be
How can I see when you cover my eyes?
And can I just sleep when I'm so fucking tired?
So tell me right now what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be
Yeah, ooh, what you wanna do is tell me off, no
What you wanna do is fuck me up, ooh
What you not gonna do is top me off
So excuse me for an hour while I love myself
You told me, you'd protect my heart, you'd be my goalie
Thinkin' 'bout the bullshit that you sold me
And I know that I ain't perfect, but you so mean
We were homies
You trip me up just to watch me fall
Smoke another cigarette, wash the last one down
So down, down, 'til I'm flat on my face
You're the reason why I get so high

How am I free when you hold me so tight?
How can I beam when you blocking my light?
I cannot be what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be
How can I see when you cover my eyes?
And can I just sleep when I'm so fucking tired?
So tell me right now what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be

Got a custom diamond ring and no, he don't got a wife
Got a large amount of things, I can't total the price
I told her I don't need her, she can leave out my life (Life)
You only get one try, but if it's lit, we go twice (Twice)
Uh, pull up in a hard top, it's a drop-top (Top)
Told you we'd be multimillionaires, why lie? (Lie)
She know I do not care for no pressin' my mind
The federal skeleton on my wrist say prime-time (Time)
How couldn't you just let me be me?
You starting to be measly (Measly)
I couldn't even find out 'cause you leavin' me
You can tell I'm pure, you can feel my energy (Energy)
Really rich, we ain't living free
Got to keep it solid, and we all agree
You might also like
How am I free when you hold me so tight?
How can I beam when you blocking my light?
I cannot be what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be
How can I see when you cover my eyes?
And can I just sleep when I'm so fucking tired?
So tell me right now what you want me
What you want me, what you want me to be

Ooh, ah, ah, ah, ah5Embed
