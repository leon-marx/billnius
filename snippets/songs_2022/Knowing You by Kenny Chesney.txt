Knowing You Lyrics
Knowing you, you probably got your toes in the sand
At a bar on a beach in the sun somewhere
Knowing you, you got something cold in your hand
Chatting up a stranger without a care
Knowing you, you're still wild and free
And knowing you, you're probably way over me

But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you
Knowing you was a free-fall from a hundred thousand feet
When you don't even care where you land
And knowing you was the kind of rush that you feel
When you finally get to sit in with the band
And knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

But God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
But I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing you

Knowing you, you're still a tumbleweed
I only wish that you would tumble back to me

'Cause God, we were so alive
I was a kid on a carnival ride
Holdin' my breath 'til the moment
When you were gonna leave me too soon
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good
I'd do it all over
'Cause, damn, it was good knowing youYou might also likeEmbed
