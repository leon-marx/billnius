TranslationsPortuguesGHETTO GATSBY Lyrics
I'm sorry I've been out of touch
You said I be out of town too much
Flyer than the wind, I'm Gatsby (Uh)
I'm probably faded when you see me on the TV, I can't help that
I'm just playing cards, I was dealt bad
But I got models in the Sprinter

I can't buy you happiness if you ain't got it
Move you to a place, still ain't what you wanted
New new face, still not Lauren London
But you're still a dime if you ask me
Uber XL, love stains in the back seats
Windows down, I would hate to drive past me
I got models in the Sprinter (Uh)
Sprinter, count it up
In the Sprinter, Sprinter
It's never enough
I just overpaid for a Maybach (Yah, yeah, yeah)
Tell you hit up Baby for th new strap
Yeah I got it on me, on me
My life is gold and I love the rush
(I like your bitch) On me, on me (Ooh baby)
I need it all the time, I don't play 'bout mine

I'm sorry I've been out of touch
You said I be out of town too much
Flyer than the wind, I'm Gatsby (Uh)
I'm probably faded when you see me on the TV, I can't help that
I'm just playing cards, I was dealt bad
But I got models in the Sprinter

I can't buy you happiness if you ain't got it
Move you to a place, still ain't what you wanted
New new face, still not Lauren London
But you're still a dime if you ask me
Uber XL, love stains in the back seats
Windows down, I would hate to drive past me
I got models in the sprinter  (Uh)

They said they be balling, why they lying?
Tryna stunt like they beyond the pines
Fuck a wine-and-dine, we do dinner now
Read between the lines, we'll be in-and-out
Bring the car out front and walk me out
Driver ain't outside my house, I'm staying in tonight
I'm feeling really nice
Good views, good weed, wearing plenty ice
Blew 300 thousand on me yesterday
Know me baby, you can check my resume
Been rich been paid, all this art inspire me
Been fire, can't nobody fire me
Been I, we know who you tryna be
Dumb fly, ain't nobody high as me
Baby I'm a choosy lover, Isley
Rely on me like pages in your diaryEmbed
