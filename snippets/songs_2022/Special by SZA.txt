I wish I was that girl from that Gucci store
She never wore any makeup and she owns couture
I got pimples where my beauty marks should be
I got dry skin on my elbows and knees
I never liked her, wanted to be like her
Hate how you look at her 'cause you never saw me
Like I was an art piece, like I was an ordinary girl

I wish I was special
I gave all my special
Away to a loser
Now I'm just a loser
I used to be special
But you made me hate me
Regret that I changed me
I hate that you made me
Just like you
Just like you
I wanted to be thick, now I wanna be thin
Heard Pilates is in, bash your windows out
You gon' hear my mouth, you could kick me out
You say I'm too wild, you gon' hate me now
Boy, you got me fucked up, now I'm gettin' fucked up
Thinkin' 'bout us fucking, why you'd have to fuck her?
I don't wanna see you, why'd you have to treat me
Like I was an ordinary girl?

I wish I was special
I gave all my special
Away to a loser
Now I'm just a loser
I used to be special
But you made me hate me
Regret that I changed me
I hate that you made me
Just like you
Just like you
