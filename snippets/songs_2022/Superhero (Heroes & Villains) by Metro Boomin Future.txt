TranslationsPortuguesEspanolTurkceSuperhero (Heroes & Villains) Lyrics

Yeah, yeah, two
(Metro)
Yeah, yeah
Drinking dope turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah
Hit that pill, turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah (Super)
Boominati turned me to a superhero, yeah, yeah (Metro)
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you)
I'm on that dope again, I'm on that flow again
Switch up the flow again, yeah, yeah (Switch it)
Flyer than a parachute, grippin' that pole again
I'm on that oil again, yeah, yeah

Candy in the cup, gotta get paid (What?)
King of the streets (Yeah), young nigga made
Sprayin' up the crowd, tak it to the grave
Ain't having problems, I'm sipping th Barre
Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star
Nigga get rich, better take it to war (Yeah)
Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad
Do you somethin' nasty, roll you in a 'gar
Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car
I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow
I put a brand new Rollie on your arm
Ain't moving slow but I'm still on oil (Skrrt)
Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost (Frost)
Cuban links all the way up to your jaw (All the way up)
Step up the swag when I step on a broad

Two dollar a half, ooh, that's the cheapest one
Stacking these hundreds up, like coupons
Told you from the begin, upper echelon
I get to stacking up, I'm untouchable
I get to represent, money multiple
I'm at the top of the charts, unapproachable
Bread by the loaf, turbo the motor
Tic-Tac-Toe, kill another vulture
Selling the bowls, bitch do yoga
I deserve awards, serving these boulders
A hundred grand large when I shop, that's the total
Fill up the garage, bitch, I'm a mogul
Ain't no facadin', ain't no fugazi
I jump it off, I get paid
Drop top Royce, I'm going crazy
I push off, smoking on haze
Not tryna floss, Cartier shades

Candy in the cup, gotta get paid (What?)
King of the streets (Yeah), young nigga made
Sprayin' up the crowd, take it to the grave
Ain't having problems, I'm sipping the Barre
Shoutout to Dallas, my bitch is a star
Nigga get rich, better take it to war (Yeah)
Piss on your casket, shoot at your broad
Do you somethin' nasty, roll you in a 'gar
Bitch get graphic, fuck me in a car
I get you a brand new Rollie tomorrow
I put a brand new Rollie on your arm
Ain't moving slow but I'm still on oil (Skrrt)
Tennis bracelets and they came with the frost (Frost)
Cuban links all the way up to your jaw (All the way up)
Step up the swag when I step on a broad


Dark Knight feeling, die and be a hero
Or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
Soon as you up, these niggas wanna bring you down
The weight of the world sit on my shoulders, hold the crown
I ain't got a cape so I can't save you now
Niggas wanna hate (Yeah), rather see you drown (Yeah)
And the world keep spinnin' (And)
Like I'm the only one in it (Am I the only one?) Why?
They don't wanna see you winnin' (No, no, no, no)
So who's really the villain? (Yeah, ooh)
Who's the villain? Who's the villain?
Live long enough to see yourself become a villain18Embed
