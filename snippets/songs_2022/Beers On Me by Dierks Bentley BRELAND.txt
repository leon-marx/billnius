Beers On Me Lyrics
Everybody's got a problem, so do I
But we ain't gonna solve 'em on a Saturday night
I just put a paycheck in the bank
And I ain't hit the town in a minute to drink
You had one of them, one of those weeks
Stuck on repeat, I'll save you a seat

Come on down, swing on by
Bring whatever's been on your mind
Locals on tap and bottles on ice
Livin' on feel-good standard time
My card's on the bar, you've got nowhere to be
If you don't come through, buddy, that's on you
'Cause the beer's on me, yeah, the beer's on me (Ain't that right, Hardy?)
Yeah, I'ma get a round or two for all I want
Just a-bustin' your back while you're cussin' the sun
And if your girl don't love you no more
Wll, here's a tall boy to cry in and it's been paid for
And if you're short on cash, say, "Cheers"
Don't swat it, leave the sweatin' to the beer and

Come on down, swing on by
Bring whatever's been on your mind
Locals on tap and bottles on ice
Livin' on feel-good standard time
My card's on the bar, you've got nowhere to be
If you don't come through, buddy, that's on you
'Cause the beer's on me, yeah, the beer's on me

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, mm (Drink it down)
I like my drinks like my roof, on the house
We turnin' up, got double cups, the sun's goin' down (Woo, ooh)
With lagers, I'm a boxer, yeah, I need 'bout twelve rounds
And I could be your sponsor if you like how that sounds
Tell me what you're drinkin', buckets for a Lincoln
I could cover you and me and everyone you're bringin'
You might also like
Come on down, swing on by
Bring whatever's been on your mind
Locals on tap and bottles on ice
Livin' on feel-good standard time
My card's on the bar, you've got nowhere to be
If you don't come through, buddy, that's on you
'Cause the beer's on me, yeah, the beer's on me
The beer's on me, gonna save you a seat (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause the beer's on me

Come get a Bud heavy, Busch Light
Kill a cold Miller, Blue Moon, Red Stripe
Naturday don't matter to me
'Cause don't nothin' taste better than free
Yeah, the beer's on me1Embed
