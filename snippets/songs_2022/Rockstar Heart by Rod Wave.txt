Rockstar Heart Lyrics
Spendin' all that money at the jewelry store
If they ain't do it for you, then who they do it for?
Hopin' that it make 'em more acceptable, woah (Yeah)
Okay, Hellcats (Okay) on Hellcats
But this rental car get more mileage (Yeah)
Finna sell the Maybach with no problem (Yeah)
You know the backseat, it make 'em nauseous (Uh-huh)
Copped the Rolls Royce truck (Yeah)
'Cause I felt like that bitch was gangster
Hand on neck, hand on frontal (Ayy, don't get it twistd)
Sex too good to give it to strangers, yah ('Cause I be on my shit)

What if I threw in the towel? (Okay)
On this rapper lifestyle, be as normal as I can be (As I can be, yeah)
Take of these clothes, no jewelry (Yeah)
Could you still see my rockstar heart? (Yeah) Yeah, (Yeah, yeah) yeah
My rockstar heart, uh, uh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Rockstar heart

You know, I never really been hatin' on all that jewelry (Yeah, yeah)
And all that, I was chillin'
But you know, I kinda felt like, you know
Don't, don't, don't, you now what I'm sayin'? Don't, don't, don't, don't disrespect my mind, or
Under-underestimate me, you know what I'm sayin'
All this shit, I get all this shit (Ooh, woah, oh)
I still feel nothin', I still feel the same
The next time we go in the jewelry store, you tell me if that bitch look like your friend (Rockstar heart)
You tell me how this shit make you feel
And I saved up the hunnids off the ground and all that money
We go in the Gucci store and you tell me that if that bitch look like your friend
Prayin' on me, and I know, I know that's what we do
You know, this the shit a nigga always wanted, even when I was broke
And I bought a million, I bought a million dollar mansion
Spent all the time in my apartment
You know, I ain't been in that bitch since October
It's crazy what we do to feel accepted by society, you know
You know the older I get, the more I, the more IYou might also likeEmbed
