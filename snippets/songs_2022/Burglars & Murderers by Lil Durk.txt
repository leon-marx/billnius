Burglars & Murderers Lyrics
I only let certain niggas in the studio with me
Ain't no such thing as that, playing entourage, you hear me?
I hang with all killers
Gang

I been getting the bag before I came from the hood, I had to wash up with a rag (Yeah)
Standing on corners, serving on Father's Day, the closest I had to a dad (Let's get it)
I kept a gun 'cause them niggas across the streets want beef, they wanted me dead (Grrah, grrah)
And I be out of my mind, my bitch be mad the way I be mixing these meds (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger, man, what?)
It's a glitch in the streets, I can't ven trust my peeps (Let's get it)
I can't go without drinking a week (A week)
I can't lave without freaking my bitch (My bitch)
I don't trust her, I watch her pee (Let's get it)
And I served my uncle a fifth (A fifth)
One thousand, I make 'em a G (A G)
I was broke, I was robbing for weed (Let's get it)
The landlord ain't believe I was 'sleep (Let's get it)
I couldn't even go pay my lease (Let's get it)
Told the feds I ain't no chief (Let's get it)
High-end, she wear GG (Let's get it)
On the block, our strikers on E (Let's get it)
They'll try to indict you for free (Let's get it)
And all my niggas kids, I'm their uncle so you can't wife my niece (Let's get it, yeah)
He came from a killer, he went to a robber, he hitting the scammers
I'm from the 'Raq, when these niggas died, you put 'em in music and make 'em a anthem
I don't know shit 'bout bodies, I played 'sleep all three days, ain't give 'em a answer
Couple opps got hit in they top, but some of 'em dead but some in Pampers
If you was good around me in school days, blood look like Kool-Aid
I'm around niggas who sold drugs to school teachers every Tuesday
And I'm gangster, nigga
Hang with the burglars, turn 'em to murderers
Hang with the burglars, turn 'em to murderers

Hang with the burglars, turn 'em to murderers (DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)
Hang with the burglars, turn 'em to murderers

Yeah, if he don't re-up with a hundred, ain't servin' him (Know I ain't servin' him)
Make a thousand per bag that I'm purchasin' (Per bag that I'm purchasin')
Bruh got a body but might be a virgin (Might be a virgin)
Hit with a thirty, he died in his surgery (Pwah)
He was woofin', you know I took it personal
Been a boss, but suit up like I'm workin' (Know that I'm workin')
I'm in the field, still in cleats and my jersey
Killed all his brothers, I know that it hurt 'em
Money ain't helpin', it's makin' it worser (Makin' it worse)
Now it's a semi, the switch, it convert it (Convert it)
First it was thirty, now fifty to murk 'em (Fifty to murk em')
Chopper bullets have a tough nigga twerkin' (Ayy)
I really turned up from servin' them turkeys
Keep tabs on our burners, they know I'm the turntest
Glock for a slide, I have Durk here to merch it
2020, ask who had the most murders, yeah
