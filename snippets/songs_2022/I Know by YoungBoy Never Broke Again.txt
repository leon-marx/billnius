TranslationsKnow Like I Know Lyrics
Fah, shoot at a nigga in the face behind NBA
Believe that (Bah, bah, bah)
You already know that be my song (Steppin' in place, nigga)
Goddamn, BJ with another one
Shoutout to KP for that beat
Like I know, know like I know
What she say? What she say, she say "Big 4L"?
Ayy, ayy, ayy, get on your ass
Bboy dripping that
Ayy, I bet your mama be destroyed, nigga
When we send your stupid ass to God
For makin' statements, choosin' sides
About my beef with them lil' boys
I could say I saw it, you could say I was your favorite, nigga
Better stay up in your place, bitch
Fuck around and get your face split any day, nigga
They know I'm a demon, you ain't met the devil until you seen me
Yah, I get 'em hit, we gon' kill a bitch insid of Neiman's for any reason
I don't give a fuck 'bout how you treat your body, give a fuck about your cleaning
I don't give a fuck about no bitch
You could have those hoes 'cause I don't need 'em
They know I step on shit, play around with that slime, oh
I seen the blues, know you in tune, but how we knock 'em down like dominos
YoungBoyLuciano, we pull on side, shoot up the car though
Plenty of clips like Leonardo, them slimes go wherever I go

I want his soul, he gon' get it (Get it)
I hope you know like I know, gon' die from choosin' sides though
I'm smellin' blood and I'm fiendin' (I'm fiendin', I'm fiendin')
Bitch, you gon' die and I know, your momma cryin' on front row

Nigga better ask Blasian about me
How we catch 'em bad and take his shit
Leave 'em stripped, the police think we raped the bitch
Nigga better not play with this
And my momma know I'm a demon seed, I'm into facin' shit
Hope yo' niggas know not be inside that car soon as that Draco hit
Old pussy ass nigga, ain't no coppin' pleas, shouldn't've said shit
You ain't gettin' no pass, nigga
You gon' rep the same block as that bitch, that's gon' be your ass, nigga
Who runnin', duckin' all these sticks
I'm lettin' you know I ain't even serious on this bitch, nigga, suck my dick
I'm facin' seven years, I ain't known to shed a tear, these niggas dyin'
I be the slime, these niggas could click up all they want, bitch crossed that line
He posted cars but ain't got more whips than as I, huh?
All you hoe-ass niggas together ain't got more millions than AI, huh?
On the phone with Stunna, my five
Now it's my time, while in the house, reside
These niggas feelin' lucky, claim that they thuggin'
But know that be my style, scary ass ain't realer than my child
Lose or win, bitch, I'm gon' dive if no gun at my side
I'm a gangsta and all that claimin' they propopsin', I bet I'll make it stop
You might also like
I want his soul, he gon' get it
I hope you know like I know, gon' die from choosin' sides though
I'm smellin' blood and I'm fiendin'
Bitch, you gon' die and I know, your momma cryin' on front row

All these niggas tryna be the biggest rapper
While I'm tryna wrap 'em in a body bag
With a toe tag and his last meetin' with the pastor
I know a nigga who got Instagram and Twitter still ain't tryna master
How to play with and you know I play for keeps, know I'll clap you
I don't give a fuck, my nigga, just like your friend, you'll bite the dust, nigga
Nigga, that ain't blood, you ain't ready to see some brains around the club
Them niggas scared, know they can't fuck with us
But that's the sides you run with
Know my mom and all my sister and all my brothers be on dumb shit
I'm a grown-ass man, so on the Internet, I don't post pics
I'm too caught up in this thug life, I'm still hidin' from the feds list
In my bed I see the interview, and my first thought, man, I said this
"Whole industry don't even know me but they still wanna see my head split"

Huh, these niggas hoes, these niggas know I know
You hear me, I don't, I don't think these niggas wanna do it, slime
I'm surprised, your parents ain't telling you, you don't wanna do it, slime
You heard me, these niggas know how I get down
And fuck all these niggas
The whole industry don't like me and I don't like all them bitches
Believe that, it's gravediggin' 4KTrey, Nawfside 38
We put guns to the face, bitch ass nigga, who gon' die today
Free DDawg, hah
I don't like none of these niggas, I don't like none of 'em
I don't like, I don't like nobody
Bitch ass nigga, what you gon' do?
You could fuck all of my baby mommas, I don't like them hoes neither
Fuck 'em, nigga, fuck 'em
I want his soul, he gon' get it
I hope you know like I know, gon' die from choosin' sides though
I'm smellin' blood and I'm fiendin'
Bitch, you gon' die and I know, your momma cryin' on front row

Your momma cryin' on front row, yeah
I hope you know like I know
