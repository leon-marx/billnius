(Ayy)
Pinky ring worth 'bout two-fifty (Ooh, ayy)
Two-tone my Lambo', that's drippy (Ooh, ayy)
Bottle after bottle, now she tipsy (Ooh)
Can't trust these hoes 'cause they iffy (Ooh, ayy)
I know that your best friend gon' slide now (Ooh, ayy)
Party at my house, that's a vibe now (Ooh, ayy)
Ballin' on these hoes like LeBron now (Ooh)
She spittin' off the top, that's a freestyle
Ayy, I'm 'bout to run it up
I'm 'bout to pull up in that motherfuckin' Bentley truck (Ayy)
Got some bad bitches and they 'bout to fuck it up (Ayy)
And we takin' shit over just to sum it up, sum it up
Yeah, I need my commas, lil' bitch
I ain't playin', man, I put that on my mama and shit
Twenty-four on the jersey, just for Mamba and shit
Vince Carter on the beat, I put my arm through the rim

It's your birthday
Put your hands in the air if it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck, it's not your birthday (Birthday)
You should be throwin' that back in the first place
It's Breezy, know you heard of me

Ooh, yeah
Pinky ring worth 'bout two-fifty (Ooh, ayy)
Two-tone my Lambo', that's drippy (Ooh, ayy)
Bottle after bottle, now she tipsy (Ooh)
Can't trust these hoes 'cause they iffy (Ooh, ayy)
I know that your best friend gon' slide now (Ooh, ayy)
Party at my house, that's a vibe now (Ooh, ayy)
Ballin' on these hoes like LeBron now
She spittin' off the top, that's a freestyle

I'm about to turn it up, a hundred degrees
Got my baby goin' up, flight overseas
I don't know where your girl at, she missin'
I'm a bad boy like a Detroit Piston
Nigga, I might smash on yo' bitch, Mitch Richmond
Cookin' up that hot shit, yeah, we in the kitchen
You been workin' out, girl, lookin' real temptin'
The way you make it clap, tonight I might tip you

It's your birthday (Birthday)
Put your hands in the air if it's your birthday (Birthday)
And you know we don't give a fuck, it's not your birthday (Birthday)
You should be throwin' that back in the first place (First place)
It's Breezy, know you heard of me

Your body makes me feel a way
Just make it shake
I want you to put it all in my face
Make it nasty (Ah)
Bad bitch (Bad), walked in (Woah-woah)
Her friends locked in (Bad), top ten (Woah-woah)
Toxic I am, yes, ma'am (Yeah-yeah)

Put your hands in the air if it's your birthday (Birthday, ooh)
