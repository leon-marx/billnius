TranslationsDark Red Lyrics
Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
I don't know what, but I feel it coming
Might be so sad, might leave my nose running
I just hope she don't wanna leave me (Babe)

Don't you give me up, please don't give up
On me, I belong, with you, and only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you
Something bad is 'bout to happen to me
Why I feel this way? I don't know, maybe
I think of her so much, it drives me crazy
I just don't want her to leave me (Babe)

Don't you give me up, please don't give up
On me, I belong with you, and only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you

What if she's fine?
It's my mind that's wrong
And I just let bad thoughts
Linger for far too long
What if (If) shes fine? (Fine)
Its my mind thats wrong
And I just (Just) let bad thoughts (Thoughts)
Linger for far too long

Don't you give me up, please don't give up
On me, I belong, with you, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only you, babe
Only you, my girl, only you, babe
Only you, darling, only youYou might also like76Embed
