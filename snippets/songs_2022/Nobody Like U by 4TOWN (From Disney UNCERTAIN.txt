Nobody Like U Lyrics
Yeah-yeah, ooh, yeah

I've never met nobody like you
Had friends and Ive had buddies, it's true
But they don't turn my tummy the way you do
Ive never met nobody like you
Oh-yeah, yeah

You're never not on my mind, oh my, oh my
I'm never not by your side, your side, your side
I'm never gon' let you cry, oh, cry, don't cry
I'll never not be your ride or die, alright
Let's call it what it is, its a masterpiece
Got a whole lotta love for them city streets
(Glendale) Tonight is the place to be
Got a big boombox and a new CD
(Come on) Everybody lets tear it up
If you want mad skills, you can share with us
(I want) Everybody to stop and stare
And you know why, it's me (Robaire)

Woo, uh
Its too good
Yeah, haha
Let's go

You're never not on my mind, oh my, oh my
I'm never not by your side, your side, your side
Im never gon' let you cry, oh, cry, don't cry
I'll never not be your ride or die, alright

Li-li-like you
Li-li-li-like you
Li-li-like you
(Like you, like you)
Li-li-like you
Li-li-li-like you
Li-li-li-like you
(Like you, like you)

I've never met nobody like you
Had friends and I've had buddies, it's true
But they don't turn my tummy the way you do
I've never met nobody like you

You're never not on my mind, oh my, oh my
I'm never not by your side, your side, your side
I'm never gon' let you cry, oh, cry, don't cry
I'll never not be your ride or die, alright18Embed
