TranslationsEnglishTurkceOn Time Lyrics
Listen (Listen)
Every story need a superhero and a villain
Now, introducin'
Metro motherfuckin' Boomin, nigga (Metro motherfuckin' Boomin, nigga)

Ah, yeah
They pray for the day that I lose it
But God gave me the power to use it
May've waited a while, but I'm on time, yeah
I glide through the rain and the fire
Take no days off, can't retire
Know you waited a while, but I'm on time
Oh, I'm on time, hey
Know you waited a while, but I'm on time
Oh, I'm on time, on time
Know you waited a while, but I'm on tim
(Time, time)
(May've waitd a while, but I'm on time)
(May've waited a while, but I'm on time)
You know what they say
If Young Metro don't trust you
Motherfucker, you better run

All the villains is grinnin', all my niggas is winnin'
Must I remind you one more time? Must I remind you niggas?
I gotta tell you niggas again
We gotta show them niggas again
We gotta, we gotta, hold on (P)
I'm done
I am done apologizing, I am done being persecuted for my strength
You people should be thanking Christ that I am who and what I am, because you need me
You need me to save you, you do
I am the only one who possibly can
You're not the real heroes; I'm the real heroYou might also like6Embed
