Oh, oh, oh
Mmm
Mmm

I don't wanna be alone (I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna die alone (I don't wanna die alone, no)
I don't wanna be alone (No, no, no, don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna die alone (Oh), no-no-no, no-no-no
Tell me what is head for?
I just wanna bone her, get it 'til the morning
What you can't control it, hold it
Birkins for the longest
Down to feel lonely
Rest in peace to Chromie (Chrome, Chrome)
What the fuck these niggas on?
Say I'm takin' shit the wrong way
I still got me some sold-out date shows
Foreigns back to back, we like to race
My heart been in a btter place
Mmm, stickin' around to hold me down, I hop it's you
Who gonna win, stick it to the end, ain't no clue (Ain't no clue)
Don't need your love 'cause I will get love from my crew (Love my crew)
Don't need that light, you with me, then just tell me the truth

I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
No more second chances
I don't wanna die alone (Don't wanna die alone)
You can take my soul for ransom
I don't wanna be alone (I'm so used to getting things my way, I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna die alone (Oh, I can't see my life when you live this way)

I don't wanna die alone
Is you givin' out that pussy when I'm not at home?
I'm in the streets and you can hit me on my trap phone
You can leave the house this morning, never come back home (Yeah)
I gotta stay on my pivot (I gotta stay on my pivot)
I gotta be realistic, these niggas some real bitches
We trappin' the real kitchen
Never bakin' soda, Pyrex on the counter, we gon' flood the money counter
Fuck the smell, I can deal with it
He was tryna stack his cheese, he got killed by the dentist
Better talk to God before you get in beef with my gremlins
Better talk to God before you have to pay for your sins
Walk him down, pop out with a mini cannon
That's a baby Drac', make 'em do the Shiggy challenge
Bust it, make it shake, I can't even keep my balance
We on our second date, and I made her pay the balance
'Cause I don't wanna

I don't wanna be alone (Don't wanna be alone)
No more second chances (I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna die alone (Don't wanna die alone)
You can take my soul for ransom (I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be alone (I'm so used to getting things my way, I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna die alone (Oh, I can't see my life when you live this way)
No-no-no, no-no-no

Got you on your knees on a private island (Yeah)
Fuck you on the beach, turn you to a siren
Riptides wanna swallow me
Feel this tip and ride 'cause I'm the wave
Swimmin' in it like a Pisces, know that pussy like me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And you know I like 'em feisty
Give me what I want and get your way
When she hit me with the sloppy
Put my hand on all her toppy
Got me screamin', "Woah, woah, woah" (Woah)
Lil' mama left me with no option
But to put it her in a coffin
Beat it up, speed it up, slow
That bitch tsunami she be wet
I crash into it, it's a wipeout
Ten toes in the air
I don't wanna be alone
No more second chances
I don't wanna die alone
You can take my soul for ransom
I don't wanna be alone (No-no-no-no, I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna die alone (Oh, I can't see my life when you live this way)
