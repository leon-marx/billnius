TranslationsEspanolStay Alive Lyrics
Stay alive...

Stay alive...
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, George, attack the British forces.
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence
The cavalrys not coming

But, sir!

Alex, listen. Theres only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

Thats right

Dont engage, strike by night
Remain relentless til their troops take flight

Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight
Outrun

Outrun
Outlast

Outlast

Hit em quick, get out fast

Chick-a-plao!

Stay alive til this horror show is past
Were gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast
Raise a glass!

I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every days a test of our camaraderie
And bravery
You might also like
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And evry day
Sir, entrust me with a command,
And evry day

No

He dismisses me out of hand

Stay alive...
Instead of me, he promotes Charles Lee (Charles Lee)
Makes him second-in-command:

Im a General. Whee!!!!

Yeah. Hes not the choice I would have gone with

He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

Evryone attack!

Retreat!

Attack!

Retreat!

What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

But theres so many of them!

Im sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

Ready, sir!

Have Lafayette take the lead!

Yes, sir!

A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin this to anybody who would listen:

Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n go back to plantin tobacco in Mount Vernon

Oo!!

Dont do a thing. History will prove him wrong

But, sir!
We have a war to fight, lets move along

Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

I cant disobey direct orders
Then Ill do it
Alexander, youre the closest friend Ive got

Laurens, do not throw away your shot13Embed
