My Time Lyrics
My time came back 'round, and it's right now
Know that they were thinkin' that they want me for to lose
Know that they were pressin', they was tryna find clues
I popped out, now I'm the news

Everything green in the inside
Pray to get it on when we slide
Everything that I say, know I can show for it
Mama said, "No," sold dope for it
And I even sung up in the choir
I ain't even partied, stayed in, and now I'm out now
I done seen them tell you that they love you to death and then they walk out
Let off shots, hit th ground, the only thing that he ain't walk off
And it's a sad thing to say, but they know not to play with my dawg
Hundrd plaques inside my proof vault
For when they try to say that we ain't have to make a way
Made more funds, I had to buy more guns to make it through the day
Tell me that my baby mamas don't deserve everything
Tell me that my brothers don't need money after goin' through all this pain
Slime say he ain't a rapper and he ain't trippin', I say, "Nigga, get it"
I ain't against you, thug, I'm with you, thug, if you ever need it, I'm comin' with it
Had it hard when I was comin' up and I know my mama proud I did it
High up in the sky, ain't comin' down, tell them all for to mind they business
Got put in a cycle, then I broke the mold
They don't like me, better not try it, only thing the game give a black rose
How the fuck you always right and I'm always wrong?
How you feel? I gotta keep one tight, fight for your life or might not make it home
But I say my time now
My time came back 'round, and it's right now
Know that they were thinkin' that they want me for to lose
Know that they were pressin', they was tryna find clues
I popped out, now I'm the news

Shoot dice for to pay my fifty-dollar phone bill
Every day, shot basketball with Toby, with JJ, I'd pop pills
My brother Three, he used to go to school, I was breakin' up in houses stealin'
Back and forth to jail just like my cousin Derek, but that's how we lived
Where I'm from, it's either focus or get killed
In a lifetime, it be millions that ain't make it out for real
I know niggas sold drugs when I was a child and they still
You ain't gotta grow up fast, this shit ain't leavin', it'll be here
This shit hurt so deep and bad, it make us all shed a tear

I gotta get me a bag, I'm talkin' right now
Momma, I'm up on it, know they want me for to lose
They don't really love me as bad as they talk, huh?
Hustle or don't get it, I'm the one who had to choose

My time came back 'round, and it's right now
Know that they were thinkin' that they want me for to lose
Know that they were pressin', they was tryna find clues
I popped out, now I'm the news
You might also like
I'm the news now
Yeah, I, I knew that day in prison, they was tryna find clues on a nigga and all that other shit
Like, they, they, they playin' them blues on me, they ain't believe
Like, they ain't really think nothin' of this, you know, until we turned it into somethin'
Shit, we, we still carryin' on
Yeah, and we still stayin' strong
ForeverEmbed
