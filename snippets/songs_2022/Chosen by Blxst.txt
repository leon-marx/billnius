Chosen Lyrics
Ayy, when it come to you (Sheesh)
Pistol I bust, issue with trust
Won't let no one get a piece of your love, yeah
Base it on loyalty, base it on us
I ain't the picture-perfect type, but I'm makin' it up
You say you want a bag flipper, I can't get enough
I'm rich alone, but when I'm with you I'm richer as fuck
Forbidden fruit on apple juice, can I sip on the cup?
Mix it with some 1942 and I'm hittin' you up
Girl, you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It's an ocean, I'm just imposin'
That you give it to me and just me only, yeah (Sheesh)
Girl, you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It's an ocean, I'm just imposin'
That you give it to me and just me only (Only)

Girl, you chosen
Sign this NDA, no, you can't bring no phones in
We walkin' in there like, "What's all the commotion?"
No, he can't step a foot in here if we don't know him
Treat you special, girl, I hit you with the roses
Can't stand your boyfriend, he's too controllin'
You get along better with me
Fuck it up when you bust wide open

Girl, you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It's an ocean, I'm just imposin'
That you give it to me and just me only, yeah (Sheesh)
Girl, you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It's an ocean, I'm just imposin'
That you give it to me and just me only (Only)
You might also like
Yeah, I fuck with her (Yeah)
Brand new Rollie, got you frozen (Yeah)
Two more shots, got that pussy wide open (Wide open)
Said she wanna go another round, don't provoke him
Shawty up and down on the pole like she votin'
I like when you talk that shit to me
Bitches ain't nothin' new, but you know how to do it to me (You do)
Ass up, face down, we can make a lil' movie (Ha, ha, ha, ha)
I'm the rapper, you the groupie
Got it wetter than jacuzzi (Woo)
She love me like Lucy (Lucy)
I'm a dog, I'm a dog like Snoopy (Snoopy)
Gettin' head under sheets and you sweatin' out your weave (Yeah)
Rich nigga, I ain't cheap when I like what I see (Ha)

Girl, you chosen (Yeah)
Fuck it up when you bust wide open (Bust it, ayy)
It's an ocean, I'm just imposin'
That you give it to me and just me only, yeah (Sheesh)
Girl, you chosen
Fuck it up when you bust wide open
It's an ocean, I'm just imposin'
That you give it to me and just me only (Only)2Embed
