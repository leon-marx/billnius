Walk Lyrics
Damn, Tye, you made this bitch too?
The fuck got into you?

(Walk) I'm a big stepper, I drip when I walk
I'm bringin' pressure, they run when I walk
I kicked the bitch out the Jeep, told her, "Walk"
Yeah, I jump on these beats and I walk
Slide, keep on slidin' (Walk)
Opps just keep on dyin' (Walk)
Spin 'round, spin 'round (Walk)
Step down, step down (Walk)
Hmm, Hellcat came with a exhaust
Switched out on me, must be lost
KTB, Kodak the boss
Candy paint Maybach, it gloss
Your bitch in here, she gettin' tossed
Baguettes on my neck, look like frost
I'm bussin' checks in the office
I play defens and offense
Run up, you get stpped on, I'm a demon, I throw crosses
Run down with my vest on, no such thing as being too cautious
I took all my losses to the chin and then I charged it
Fresh out of prison, I'm already spinnin', I'm right back where I started
.223s in the cartridge
5.56s and switches
Ain't sparin' none of you bitches
Want sympathy, ain't gettin' it from me
My niggas love me, it ain't 'bout the money 'cause they get to spinnin' for free
I'm from the city, no pity, lil' nigga went missin' the other day, he was just three

(Walk) I'm a big stepper, I drip when I walk
I'm bringin' pressure, they run when I walk
I kicked the bitch out the Jeep, told her, "Walk"
Yeah, I jump on these beats and I walk
Slide, keep on slidin' (Walk)
Opps just keep on dyin' (Walk)
Spin 'round, spin 'round (Walk)
Step down, step down (Walk)

Walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk, walk in
Picked up a bag when I walked in
I fucked this bitch, now the nigga keep stalkin' my page
I got too many options to main
I fuck all of my bitches the same
Turned in the Jag for a Range
I did the Dash like Dame
She see my wrist and say, "Dang"
Audemars fresh out the pan
Water whippin', walkin' 'round the kitchen with the pot right in my hand
Walk, step, slide, spin
Ain't no perc, five, ten
Big size rim
My cousin walkin' taught me this
Don't even lie, I walk
What you call that? It wasn't even my fault
One point five in the vault
I'm on the blogs anytime that I talk
Thirteen cars but I'm still gon' walk
And I'm on lean today
Now they got behind me, they didn't even chase
They don't fuck with me 'cause they know they can't

(Walk) I'm a big stepper, I drip when I walk
I'm bringin' pressure, they run when I walk
I kicked the bitch out the Jeep, told her, "Walk"
Yeah, I jump on these beats and I walk
Slide, keep on slidin' (Walk)
Opps just keep on dyin' (Walk)
Spin 'round, spin 'round (Walk)
Step down, step down (Walk)3Embed
