Me or Sum Lyrics

Drop your location, she think she me or some' (Hendrix)
Put on my chains, now she think she me or some'
She keep a Glock in her bag, she think she me or some' (Pluto)
VVS rocks with the cash, she think she me or some' (Keep it Z3N)

Came out hustlin' with the bag, oh no
I can't get it to the gossip
Bitch can't see me in binoculars
Run up the check up in Prada
You runnin' 'em racks up, I'm proud of you
All bad bitch eat seafood
Took the hot box on a detour
Came back, red on the bottom of my shoe
Posted with devils, she thinkin' she me or some'
Canary yellow, she thinkin' she me or some'
Step like a stepper, she drippin' Emilio Pucci
She think she me or some'
She barely ever poppin' outside
But when she do (When she do), tryna kill some'
My number one hitter, always movin' in silence
She the truth, real one
You can ask her if she gang, gang
She gon' tell you she rep the same thing I do (Yeah)
She not my main thing
But on the weekends, she lovin' my crew, lovin' my crew

She said she got a man, I act deaf, I don't hear her
Come here, girl, stop playin', let me put it in your liver (Put it in your liver)
Eat what's in my pants, bae, don't gotta go to dinner
I stole her heart, thou shall not steal, like I'm sorry, I'm a sinner
Let her put my chains on, now she think she me or somethin'
Got a special ringtone, when it beep, I know she comin'
She just put her hair on, now she think she flee or somethin'
Nardo hit that G spot, when she scream, I know she cummin'
I put her in LV, on my feet is LV
I think I'm a lover boy, sing to your bitch like Elvis
My bitch in the front seat, my other bitch in back seat
Nardo, who your other bitch? I'm talkin' 'bout my choppy
Know I keep a bankroll, "Baby, count my bankroll"
Put it in your purse, she say, "It's too much, bae, it won't go
Too much, bae, it won't fold, too much, bae, I'm gon' choke"
I know I got a lot of y'all, but, baby, you my favorite ho

She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not

Baby in this bitch like, "Let me through here"
I need millions for the new year
Send a threat, I send my crew there
Know they hate how big I blew up
Got that check for real, went Audemars Piguet and bought my boo one
Think my favorite car's my blue one, pop that shit for real, I do this
Put my heart inside my safe deposit box 'cause I ain't gon' use it
I made forty million last year, and that's just off my music
I done finally got the mothafuckin' ball, and I ain't gon' lose it
Seem like everybody snoozin' while I'm steadily improvin'
I get money like I'm Jewish, I'm gon' be the one
She got all them bracelets up her arm, look like she me or somethin'
She get new Chanel whenever she want to like it's free or somethin'
I been buyin' Birkin bags for bitches like they three for one
Excuse my French, I'm sorry, mommas, this Phantom cost five hunnid
I been lit for five summers, everyone know how I'm comin'
Real exotic bags for thirty-five, we got our side pumpin'
Niggas don't want war with us, I'll spin until my last hunnid, yeah

Rackies on rackies, now she think she me or some'
Dressin' like she tecky, now she think she me or some'
Count up cash really fast, now she think she me or some'
Keep the extendo in her bag, now she think she me or some'
Walked in with a baddie, now she think she me or some'
Gon' drop the addy, now she think she me or some'
Bust down an Audemars, now she think she me or some'
Cop another foreign car, now she think she me or some'
Bitch don't need a stylist, she must think she me or some'
Always goin' viral, she must think she me or some'
Turn up on a bad ho, she must think she me or some'
Diamonds on her rings and her chain, think she me or some'
Posted up, runnin' with her gang, think she me or some'
Flawless, Freeband gang, reppin' like she me or some'
Mm, Pluto
Wicked
Nardo, you got you one with this one6Embed
