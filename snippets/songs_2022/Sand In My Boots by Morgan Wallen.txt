Sand in My Boots Lyrics
She asked me where I's from
I said "Somewhere you've never been to
Little town outside of Knoxville"
Hiddin' by some dogwood trees
She tried talkin' with my accent
We held hands and waded into
That blue water
She left her flip-flops by my Red Wings on the beach

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed m tells me she'd lov Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?" (Huh)
So we drank bottom shelf
She said "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said "Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home"
And she said "Maybe I should, see 'em for myself"

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

I said "Meet me in the mornin'"
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up

Aw, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my bootsYou might also like8Embed
