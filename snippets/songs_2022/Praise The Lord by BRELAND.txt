Praise the Lord Lyrics
Praise the Lord for southern women, Hemi engines, crispy chicken
Praise the Lord for east Atlanta, Country Grammar, and my nana
Praise the Lord that I got everything I want and need and more
I might turn up on Saturday, but first thing Sunday morn'
I praise the Lord

Praise the Lord for sister Julie, big ol hat and tambourine
She keeps playing when were shoutin, doesnt know that shes off beat
Praise the Lord for my bartender, turns a single into two
We went crazy out there last night, we need saving in this pew
It don't matter how you worship, sinner, saint, win or lose
Praise the Lord for southern women, Hemi engines, crispy chicken
Praise the Lord for east Atlanta, Country Grammar, and my nana
Praise the Lord that I got everything I want and need and more
I might turn up on Saturday, but first thing Sunday morn'
I praise the Lord

He rockin' with me, that's for sure
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord), praise the Lord
He rockin' with me, thats for sure
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord), praise the Lord

Praise the Lord for my three babies and the one thats on the way
All the words up in the good book and dirt up on my Chevrolet
Praise the Lord for Sunday morning and paycheck Friday afternoons
For cold beer conversation and broken cowboy boots
It dont matter how you worship, sinner, saint, win or lose

Praise the Lord for southern women, Hemi engines, crispy chicken
Praise the Lord for east Atlanta, Country Grammar, and my nana
Praise the Lord that I got everything I want and need and more
I might turn up on Saturday but first thing Sunday morn
I praise the Lord
You might also like
He rockin' with me, that's for sure
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord), praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
He rockin with me that's for sure
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord), praise the Lord
Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord
Ooh, ooh, oh
Praise the Lord (Praise the Lord)Embed
