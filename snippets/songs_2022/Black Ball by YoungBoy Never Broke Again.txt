Black Ball Lyrics
On top the mountain
Lookin' down on all these niggas hatin' on me (Goddamn)
And I see I got 'em all debatin' on me
Know I'm gon' get paid, can't take this hate all free (Yeah, yeah)
Try to block me out, blackball, but they see me now
In the slums, right in that North, where the fuck I was found
I was rollin', thuggin' hard with them shottas through town
But now I'm livin' in my dream now, dream now

Draped down in designer, got these diamonds on my body
If you wit' it, then I'm 'bout it
Don't care what these people hollerin'
I say, "Pop your shit, twin"
Know I got one cocked in, yeah
They want to stop this, no, no, no, not my friend
Stop the time, know they know on thing, that my slime
That's my brother, that's my sister, and thy better not cross the line
Stop that cryin', and you can't stop that tryin', and yeah
Run wit' gravediggers, you gon' end up dyin', and yeah
911 Porsche, drive this bitch in sport mode
Jumped straight off that porch, ridin' with that torch, we play with Dracos
Lil' bro, keep it cool until that case closed (Case closed)
Until then, we live and ball and buy out all the stores (Store, store)
On top the mountain
Lookin' down on all these niggas hatin' on me (Goddamn)
And I see I got 'em all debatin' on me
Know I'm gon' get paid, can't take this hate all free (Yeah, yeah)
Try to block me out, blackball, but they see me now
In the slums, right in that North, where the fuck I was found
I was rollin', thuggin' hard with them shottas through town
But now I'm livin' in my dream now, dream now

Up your stick, 10, if I don't shoot first, know I'm shootin' behind you
That's her thick friend, and no, I want 'em both, I ain't decidin'
Now it's nightfall, hold on, let me drop my son off
These niggas know I don't like y'all, and know that I don't wan' talk
She know that I like her, she say that she like me, I wonder why she ain't admitted it?
Clubhouse with the bad lil' bitty bitches, they don't see me but know that I'm kickin' it
They be rappin' my songs, they know how I get down, they know for a fact that I'm livin' it
Now I wanna calm down, but here come the beef and they know for a fact that I'm killin' it
Uh, that my side bitch, they know that's my best friend
Ooh, pop a Perky, ain't no textin', we be sexin'
Ooh, ain't no flexin', don't wan' meet your best friend, I'm rude
Ain't no rest, sittin' on top the mountain, just laughin' at these fools

On top the mountain
Lookin' down on all these niggas hatin' on me (Goddamn, lets go)
And I see I got 'em all debatin' on me (Okay)
Know I'm gon' get paid, can't take this hate all free (Yeah, yeah)
Try to block me out, blackball, but they see me now
In the slums, right in that North, where the fuck I was found
I was rollin', thuggin' hard with them shottas through town
But now I'm livin' in my dream now, dream nowYou might also like4Embed
