TranslationsPortuguesCOMPLETE MESS Lyrics
Caught up in Heaven, but your Heaven ain't the same
And Ive never been a saint, have I?
This evanescence always fleeting like a flame
But I'm never one to change, am I?

Call it a lesson when I feel you slide away
And I'm missin out on half my life

Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess
Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess
Hang on to moments like they'll never drift away
'Cause you'll never get to say goodbye
I ask no questions as your colours take their hold
As my darkness turns to gold inside

I learned my lesson when I felt you slip away
And I'm missing out on half my life

Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess
Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete
You make me a complete mess

(You make me a complete mess)
(You make me a complete mess)

Caught up in Heaven, but your Heaven ain't the same
But I've never been a saint, have I?
You might also like
Oh, you make me complete
You make me complete (You make me complete)
You make me a complete mess (Oh)
Oh, you make me complete (You make me complete)
You make me complete (You make me complete)
You make me a complete mess21Embed
