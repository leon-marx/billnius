Hrs and Hrs (Remix) Lyrics
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ah, ah, mm-mm (Yeah)
I don't usually do this but, um (Tiller, oh my God)
Can I sing to you? (Haha, haha)
Yeah (Yeah)

Yours, mine, ours
I could do this for hours
Sit and talk to you for hours
I wanna give you your flowers
And some champagne showers
Order shrimp and lobster towers
But it's me that gets devoured
Ooh, when you do what you do, I'm empowered
You give me a superpower
Together the world could be ours
You sit me up on the counter
Instantly, it's thunder showers
Stormin' for a couple hours
When we finished, take a shower
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours, hours, I

Usually don't like nobody
And when I say nobody
I man nobody
All these niggas full of shit
You're just a homi once they hit
Felt like givin' up on love
These niggas almost made me quit
Then I met you
When I met you
I knew this was it
I've never been in love like this
A love like ours
I pray for it on my knees
Every night for some hours
And hours and hours
You might also like
Wish the day was more than twenty-four hours (Oh)
With every extra minute (Oh)
Girl, I would be lost in it
Kissin' you all over every inch
I won't stop until you're moanin'
More, more, more, more, more hours (More)
More of me lettin' you climb this tower
Makin' you rain down like April showers
Fall down, make it flood 'til I almost drown
Almost don't count
Baby, 'cause I'ma scuba dive in it
Promise to take my time in it
Girl, I'ma rock the boat (Go for hours)
Pussy mine but you can say that it's ours
(Sit here) on the counter
(Look so) precious like a flower
I admire you for hours
That pussy give me superpowers

I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
I could do this for hours
And hours and hours
What's yours is mine
And ours
And yours, mine and ours
I could sit and talk to you for hours
Sit and look at you for hours
Makin' love to you for hours
Layin' on your chest for hours (Layin' for hours)
Tellin' you jokes for hours (Jokin' around for hours)
Holdin' you close for hours
And hours and hours

Oh, oh, oh (Yee hee)
Oh, oh, oh (Yee hee)
Woah, oh, oh (Yee hee)
Ah, I
Hours and hours (Yee hee)
Hours and hours (Yee hee, yee hee)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hours and hours
Hours and hours (Hours and hours, and hours)
Woah, oh, mm
