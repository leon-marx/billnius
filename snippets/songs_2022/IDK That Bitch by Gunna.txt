(Taurus)
(Run that back, Turbo)

How the hell you love that bitch?
You don't know that bitch (How?)
That's like havin' set prices on a dummy brick (Four)
You get good pussy once and then start cuffin' it (Four)
I still been in my bag, I'm just on other shit (On other shit)
New gold BBS, look like Money Mitch (Like Money Mitch)
My stats are really rich, I'm in that Cullinan (Rolls)
She told me she takin' a risk, I had to cut her in (Cut her in)
The Rolls with a house in the hill, with a custom den (Custom)
Eliantte keep puttin' karats in my pinky ring (Karats)
Woke up, feel like Malcolm X, we kill by any means (Kill by any means)
Young Gunna Wunna stay fresh, fresh like Listerine (Fresh)
I'm givin' her back to the streets, I got plenty of these (I got plenty of those)
She a nasty freak, she came from New Orleans (New Orleans)
Damn near woke up sick, forgot to pour my lean (Pour it)
We murder things, you want a queen, can't hurt a king (Can't hurt a king)
The lemon squeeze, can't get between or intervene (Or intervene)

How the hell you love that bitch?
You don't know that bitch (How?)
It's like havin' set prices on a dummy brick (Four)
You get good pussy once and then start cuffin' it (Four)
I still been in my bag, I'm just on other shit (On other shit)
New gold BBS, look like Money Mitch (Like Money Mitch)
My stats are really rich, I'm in that Cullinan (Rolls)
She told me she takin' a risk, I had to cut her in (Cut her in)
The Rolls with a house in the hill, with a custom den (Custom)

My cousin' down the road, he call on Alamo (On Alamo)
Pick backend up, I do my show, it's time to go (Time to go)
Now hit a joke, you hit a post, I don't care to post (I don't care to post)
Got both them hoes, they lick me like an envelope (Like an envelope)
I was at the all-star game in Chicago (Chicago)
Came through the side door, I was with my side ho (Was with my side ho)
Call G Herbo and Durkio, yeah, Smurkio (Shmurkio)
Smoke Biscotti and Gelato, this ain't busted though (Run that back Turbo, busted though)

G Herbo rich as fuck, but I want a hundred M's (Millions)
Crib in the hills, straight up out the field, drillin' with a gun in hand (No doubt)
Just was in a Lamb', but I pulled on Gunna my twin in that Cullinan (Cullinan)
It's a pandemic, but I'm runnin' out of rubber bands
Cuban link, three hundred grams
Hatin' on me, I understand, one-fifty still love the fans
One-fifty in that new coupe, on the E-Way, I'm like fuck the trends
Amiri got too much pants (Know what I'm sayin'?), gave them folks three hundred grand
Fronted that much to my mans, lil' ho I got rich friends
Folks said he like Rich Porter, I can't go like Killa Cam (I know, I know)
Wipe that pussy nose 'cause I'm with slime 'nem (Slime, ayy, ayy)
He was 'posed to been there 'fore he dissed us, they can't find him (Shh)
Lovin' like you discovered her, we just missed the bitch
Remind him, clown him

That's like havin' set prices on a diamond brick (Four)
You get good pussy once and then start cuffin' it (Four)
