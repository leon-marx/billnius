Im Tired Lyrics
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired of tears
Hey Lord, just cut me loose

Hey Lord, you know I'm fighting
Hey Lord, you know I'm fighting
I'm sure this world is done with me
Hey Lord, you know it's true
Now the tide is rolling in
I don't wanna win
Let it take me, let it take me
I'll be on my way
How long can I stay?
In the place that can't contain me
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired
Hey Lord, you know I'm tired

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

Please don't say you need me
Release me, believ me
One day you will see me
Blieve me, believe me
Oh, please don't say you need me
Believe me, believe me
One day you will see me
Believe me, believe meYou might also like11Embed
