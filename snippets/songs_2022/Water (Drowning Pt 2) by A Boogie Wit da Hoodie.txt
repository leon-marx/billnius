Water (Drowning, Pt. 2) Lyrics
Ride my wave, might drown in it
My wave, my wave, might drown in it
Might drown, mm-mm, mm-mm, baby
Might drown, look, woo

Ride my wave, you won't ever need no water
(You think I was playin' when I said I'm really ballin'?)
I need two or three, just you and me, that might get borin'
I don't fuck with hoes that make up stories, not Sephora
When she with me, she know she don't ever need no water
Cheat on me, I'ma fuck your best friend, just don't get me started
I threw like a hundred thousand every month at Starlet's
Just don't tell my baby mama nothin'
From the Bronx, I got it tatted, my nigga, look
I don't do no G-Wagen unless I'm with the gang, Leo, the stragglers with us
We was really pushin' Ps and crackin' cards, but I couldn't say that in songs
They gon' try to make a case out of what I say no matter if it was true or false
All of my niggas got baptized to the streets, catch a body and talk to God
My role model brought my head up at thirteen, 50 Cent taught me how to rob
And then my mom moved me to Florida to finish high school and that's when I caught the charge
Bought a double R, treated it like a Mercedes, girl, I swear to God
And I'm from New York, you can call me baby, baby like I'm Biggie Smalls (Woo)
The way you be, the way you be sayin' my name, yeah
The way you be, been throwin' it back, different angles
And I used to be rockin' the same clothes
Thinkin' it was okay 'cause it's Balmain, oh
Birkins and Tiffanys for my main ho
Did it all, I retired to Palm Angels

Ride my wave, you won't ever need no water
(You think I was playin' when I said I'm really ballin'? Woo)
I need two or three, just you and me, that might get borin'
I don't fuck with hoes that make up stories, not Sephora
When she with me, she know she don't ever need no water
Cheat on me, I'ma fuck your best friend, just don't get me started
I threw like a hundred thousand every month at Starlet's
Just don't tell my baby mama nothin' (Just don't tell my baby mama nothin')

Ayy, all the water like a sea, I came in with A Boogie and PnB (Go)
Thuggin', I never went to BET, but I came a long way, I won in the streets, ayy
I'm ballin', I don't give a fuck what time it is, bitch, I'm goin' back to sleep, ayy
I'm bouncin', I can call up all your steppers to knock you right off of your feet, ayy
My money ran deep, rain hit my wrist, water turn to ice
Ho, you know I'm cheatin', even when I'm wrong, bitch, I'm always right
I go to New York for the jewelry, I go to North Miami for the Perky
I put the remix on the verse, nuttin' in three bitches on purpose, you heard me
Richard Mille cost a half a ounce, in a hotel tryna bust a scam
Paid three Bs for this fuckin' deal, made three hundred racks, no question
I was only tryna make it for my fam, had to make a sale, it wasn't no twists
I went on robberies to get designer jeans, so I'm stylin' free, nigga, Funk Flex

Ride my wave, you won't ever need no water (Uh-huh)
(You think I was playin' when I said I'm really ballin'? Woo)
I need two or three, just you and me, that might get borin'
I don't fuck with hoes that make up stories, not Sephora
When she with me, she know she don't ever need no water
Cheat on me, I'ma fuck your best friend, just don't get me started
I threw like a hundred thousand every month at Starlet's
Just don't tell my baby mama nothin'2Embed
