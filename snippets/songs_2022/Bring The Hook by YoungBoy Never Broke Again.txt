Bring The Hook Lyrics
Any last words?
It's a murder business
Yeah (D-Roc)

This gun was bought just for to kill niggas
What you on 4? You already know how we get down
We be them motherfuckin gravediggers
Pallbearers bring your body to the grave
We leave him slayed, nigga
It ain't a open case, we left his motherfuckin' brain missin (Grr)
Hold on, diamond chains, we leave a stain
Shawty just wan' give me brain
Slidin' in that fast thing, nigga know I blew the brains
Shawty tryna sell me things, know I want the whole thing
Know my brother sell that boy, if not heroine it's pure cocaine
Know w distributors
Them hollows, you can smell it through the city, w pollutin'
Don't aim it, you just shoot it
Like Chief Sosa say, "Better get your ass up outta here, Juwanna Mann" (Get out of here)
Text him through the night and through the day
That be my fuckin' man
Bro'nem swing that, left out stains
He in Miami and he hidin from this murder gang (He hidin)
The feds know my name, they tryna lock me up in chains
The homicide detectives say Kentrell to fuckin' blame
We leave out teddy bears right there where he bleed at
She sent the text, aint read that
I been in here with Jaz, count that bag, bitch, believe that
That Jag' matte black, bet soon as you see it, better run from that
We aimin' with them straps to leave you clapped right where we see you at
Hold on, swang that cutter, hold on, know it got a kick-back
Youngin' weighed a hundred pounds, know he cant control that
Run up on me, it's gon' go down, you know that I'ma blow that
Utah with a lot of pounds with me, where your ho at
Fuck it, bring the hook
Kill that nigga, think he saw a gremlin how his body shook
With that stick, that be my fishin' pole, another opp got hooked
I see souls, I'm with my kids
Get them fuckin' bodies outta here
I got locked inside the penn', but now I'm out
Bitch, this Don Dada year
Spotted, then we followed him
Call that boy a dead man, name that boy Rudolph
When he see that red beam, headshot, that's a skully scene
Lil Dee, that's my cousin, man
Know that he don't give no fuck, he aimin' for the head, man

Nigga, this that Squid Game, O'Block pack get rolled up
Murder what they told us, Atlanta boy get fold up
Nigga get your hoes up, these bitches throwin' up green flags
Throwin' that NBA up, for me, set you up to bust your ass
And know I keep that murder bag
Right on him, leave a toe tag
Inside the freezer, where them people put 'em 'fore they stitch his ass
No glitchin', better not freeze up before a nigga blitz his ass
Brra-baow-baow, flip his ass (Haha)
Northside, nigga know that's my side
Utah, come here bitch, get hogtied, another died
Oh Lord, man this nigga crazy, he do not respect them boys
He don't give a fuck, he check up off the list, they squad
He pray to the Devil, then that nigga pray to God
Say he got on face paint and his nigga paid for it
Say my name, get slayed for it
I ain't playin' with your ho-ass nigga
You know I'm comin' anywhere
Like, "Why the fuck you say that nigga?"
You know I'm dyin' anywhere, I bet they say I blew my pistol
I bet they say I took one with me
Lil AI Top, I'm too official
You should not play with gravediggers
You know them pallbearers ship  'em
You know I pull off plenty killings
You know that we keep plenty pistols

Fuck it, bring the hook
Kill that nigga, think he saw a gremlin how his body shook
With that stick, that be my fishin' pole, another opp got hooked
I see souls, I'm with my kids
Get them fuckin' bodies outta here
I got locked inside the penn', but now I'm out
Bitch, this Don Dada year
Spotted, then we followed him
Call that boy a dead man, name that boy Rudolph
When he see that red beam, headshot, that's a skully scene
Lil Dee, that's my cousin, man
Know that he don't give no fuck, he aimin' for the head, man

Mortician coat on, I'm doin' surgeries on his body
It been so long, they been sayin' they gon' pop my noggin
Run up on me then I cock it
In front the crowd then I pop it
Know I want smoke with anybody, no, the label can not stop it
Northside with a sawed-off shotty
Nigga, you don't want these problems
Must don't want your fuckin life
You steady talkin' like you 'bout it
I'm with these demons day and night
And you know that be my closest partner
Don't trust YoungBoy, 'cause he ain't right
You jokin', he gon' kill you 'bout it
Squeeze that Glock as soon as he sighted
Nigga stop that fuckin' talkin'
Split that boy while on a bike
Or catch him while he fuckin' walkin'
Live this shit, that's why I talk it
I'm fly, you know that I'ma hawk 'em
Make them people outline chalk 'em
Fuck it, bring the hook
Kill that nigga, think he saw a gremlin how his body shook
With that stick, that be my fishin' pole, another opp got hooked
I see souls, I'm with my kids
Get them fuckin' bodies outta here
I got locked inside the penn', but now I'm out
Bitch, this Don Dada year
Spotted, then we followed him
Call that boy a dead man, name that boy Rudolph (Rudolph)
When he see that red beam, headshot, that's a skully scene (Haha)
Lil Dee, that's my cousin, man (Yeah, yeah)
Know that he don't give no fuck, he aimin' for the head, man

You already know though
