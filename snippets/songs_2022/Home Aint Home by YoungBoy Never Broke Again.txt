Home Aint Home Lyrics
Ayo, Hzrd, run that shit back
D-Roc, D-Roc

Feelin' like my home ain't no home
And I been feelin' like the ones who I know love me all gone

Back then, when I ain't had no money
Lil Tug would pay for me to eat
Three in the mornin', time to go home
Jordan walked me halfway up the street
They say I'm weak, but I ain't beat
I'm stronger than shit that they believe
Blood on my body, I'm steady bleedin', I think I'm stuck up in the streets
Still got my momma but I'm still lookin' for my grandma love
Used to sell drugs to ones who do, but now, I'm the one that does
I'm in love with her, but this ain't my home, I can't stay right here
Sorry momma, I left, it been some years
I ain't got no one to trust
Sittin' right here, just waitin' for to be killed
Feelin' like my home ain't no home
And I been feelin' like the ones who I know love me all gone
I been tryna find my way on my own
It ain't nothin' that been comin' from it
Nothin' good been comin' from it
From my momma womb to a broken home
And I'm who that's gonna make it from it
I'm the one who made it from it

Okay, made it from it, uh, made it from it
Shots fired, man down, real dangerous slidin'
We built this house up from the ground and let 'em take it from us
Lord knows I love that girl to death and she hate me for it
Oh, Lord, oh, Lord, still feel pain, so scarred
Three houses but no home, yeah
No love to call my own, yeah
Still don't feel good all alone, yeah, mm, yeah, uh

Feelin' like my home ain't no home
And I been feelin' like the ones who I know love me all gone
I been tryna find my way on my own
It ain't nothin' that been comin' from it
Nothin' good been comin' from it
From my momma womb to a broken home
And I'm who that's gonna make it from it
I'm the one who made it from itYou might also like1Embed
