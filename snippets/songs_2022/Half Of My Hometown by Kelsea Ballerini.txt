half of my hometown Lyrics
Half of my high school got too drunk
Half of my high school fell in love with the girl next door
In their daddy's Ford
And half of my main street's mini skirts
Half of my main street's dressed for church
It could use some rain and a fresh coat of paint

Half of my hometown's still hangin' around
Still talkin' about that one touchdown
They're still wearin' red and black
"Go Bobcats" while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north, some went south
They're still lookin' for a feelin' half of us ain't found
So stay or leave, part of me will always be
Half of my hometown
Half of our prom queens cut their hair
Half of them think that it ain't fair
The quarterback moved away and never came back
Half of my family is happy I left
The other half worries I'll just forget
Where I came from
Same place where they came from

Half of my hometown's still hangin' around
Still talkin' about that one touchdown
They're still wearin' red and black
"Go Bobcats" while the other half
Of my hometown, they all got out
Some went north, some went south
They're still lookin' for a feelin' half of us ain't found
So stay or leave, part of me will always be
Half of my hometown

Mmm, half of my hometown (Oh)

Backroads raise us
Highways, they take us
Memories make us wanna go back
You might also like
To our hometown, settle down
Talk about that one touchdown
Raise some kids in red and black
"Go Bobcats" while the other half
Of our hometown was in the crowd
They knew the words, they sang them loud
And all I wanna do is make them proud
'Cause half of me will always be Knoxville, Tennessee
My hometown

Oh
My hometown
