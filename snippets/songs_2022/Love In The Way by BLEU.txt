Love In The Way Lyrics
Got this world in our hands
Like a pearl in a clam
We're lettin' go
Ayo

You blew it, I could tell you knew it
But you was like "Screw it," and I guess I'm fluid
'Cause I was like, "Fuck you and them bitches included"
'Cause I was goin' through it, ain't nothin' more to it (To it)
Baby, your love in the way (My way)
But don't stop it, just keep doin' what you do
How could I move with your love in my way? (My way)
It hurts to love again and it's all because of you
'Cause, baby, your love in the way (Your love)
I need you right now, why would you push me away? (No love)
Baby, your love in the way
I need you right now, why would you push me away?

Girl, let's move
If you can't dance, grab my hand, just do a little one-two (One-two)
It hurts to love again and it's all becaus of you
I love when you dance to th music, the DJ is playin' the right tunes
It's hard to love again and it's all because of you
(Yeah, yeah, all because of you)
It hurts to love again and it's all because of you (All because of you)

I'm beggin' for it (Beggin')
I see you givin' me those eyes, can't ignore it (I can't ignore it)
And I'm beggin' for it (For it)
I love it when your love in the way (In the way)
I don't think paradise too far away
I don't think every star is out of space
'Cause your love in the way
Holding on for dear life
I'm just here for one night
Can't trust these women 'cause your love in the way
Leading my way
What can I say?
You might also like
Girl, let's move
If you can't dance, grab my hand, just do a little one-two (One-two)
It hurts to love again and it's all because of you
I love when you dance to the music, the DJ is playin' the right tunes (The right one)
It's hard to love again and it's all because of you

All because you too busy talkin', no listenin'
You too busy doin' the talkin', no listenin' (All because of you)
I would put my ear to the walls and listen in (It hurts to love again and it's all because of you, all because of you)
Right hand on my head, I'm like, "Aw, not this again"
All because you too busy talkin', no listenin'
You too busy doin' the talkin', no listenin'
I would put my ear to the walls and listen in
Right hand on my head, I'm like, "Aw, not this again" (Not this again)

One minute you here and then you gone (Gone)
Seem like your biggest fear to be alone (Be alone)
I was givin' you your space, I was runnin' through your mind
But you runnin' out of time this time
What you expect?
You never had a queen on deck
I never was the type to be next, I'm the type to be kept
I'm the type to make a nigga regret that he slept
Girl, let's move
If you can't dance, grab my hand, just do a little one-two (One-two)
It hurts to love again and it's all because of you
I love when you dance to the music, the DJ is playin' the right tunes (The right one)
It's hard to love again and it's all because of you
(Yeah, yeah, all because of you)
It hurts to love again and it's all because of you (All because of you)

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (All because of you)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (It hurts to love again and it's all because of you)
Yeah, yeah9Embed
