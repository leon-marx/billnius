You (You), you are (You are) my universe
And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first
And you (You), you are (You are) my universe, and I

In the night, I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes, I watch you rise
There's a paradise they couldn't capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes
    ()
   
    ()
Never-ending forever, baby

You (You), you are (You are) my universe
And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first
And you (You), you are (You are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

   
   (Eyes)
And they said that we can't be togethr
Because, becaus we come from different sides

You (You), you are (You are) my universe
And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first
And you (You), you are (You are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe (Do-do, do-do)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
(You make my world)
You make my world light up inside
Make my world light up inside

When I'm without you, I'm crazy
    
We are made of each other, baby

You (You), you are (You are) my universe
And I (I) just want (Just want) to put you first (To put you first)
And you (You), you are (You are) my universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe (Do-do, do-do)
You, you are (You are)
My universe (Do-do, do-do)
I just want (Just want)
My universe
You, you are (You are) my universe, and I
My universe
