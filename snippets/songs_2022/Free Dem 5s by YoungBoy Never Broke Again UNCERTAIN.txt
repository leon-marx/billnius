Bro put a box in draws, 3.5s and scores
Phone man if you want that
Don't talk like you're bad, you ain't on that
Combat, juice gon' spill like Cognac
Whip that shit, dont stop 'til I lock that
Heard there's a mash on sale, man cop that
Verbal abuse is long, akh, stop that
Back out the mash and drop that, shot that
If you want Buju, man got that
Banton TT smash it and dot that, chop that
Countryside, where the gwops at
Jump in pics, you ain't bro, man, crop that
No whip, then pedal bike risk it, he flipped it
Back out my shank and dip it, ballistic
Push in my shank and twist it
Pebs in cling, thats Oreo biscuits
Man's machine comin' with lead
Mish and mash for the bread
This grey ting's way too fast
Bitch, pull up your drawers, I only want head
Man put dick down in her neck-neck
Bore tongue, that's the best
Ejaculate in her mouth
Or pull out, ejaculate on her breast
In the field, I'm Air Force steppin'
More time I just smashed down packs in the ends
Right now, I'm tryna get this bread in
Get 'round there and ching man up
Like, anything B get wetted
No face, no case and leathers
Four door whip with serious members
My bro wanna lurk on opps
So we go round there on a 125
Bro done whacked man's face with the longest blade
Tryna take man's eye
I heard that the opp boys ran with their shanks again
And I weren't surprised
Creepz Sav ain't on piss
He raps that shit and he ran ten times
Packs on me, Rambz on me
Push bike hitting them shoots
Peng gyal on man from the B
Feelin' me and MSkum, too
My bros ain't down for the stuntin'
Digga D grab that dots and shoot
Us man ain't like them man
Them man lie and we tell the truth
Gang
Like, free all my bros, soon touch road
How many times have I rid on Bush?
Like one of them boys gotta go
Back out my ting and make man swim
Like ching man down on volts
Catch me a opp then stab up his head
Then ten toes back to the Grove
Then ten toes back to the Grove
You might also like
Friend of a opp is a opp
So I won't feel a way to go burn that bridge
My nigga Huncho gave him twenty-two chings
I can bet you that he's feelin' pissed
Get 'round there, Samurai's and flicks
JSav put his whole Rambz in your wig
My bro Digga D had the whole HR locked off
When he crossed that bridge
If I get my hands on a opp
I ain't wettin' him once, I'm wettin' him numerous times
See a opp right there, tell bro don't jerk the car
Just keep it movin' in line, ay
Four and a half, got bags of ball and dust
Man slap it in tens
If I back my splash, he don't back it up
No leg shots, man put it in chests
Like, bros got a thing for dargs
Teefin' cats I ain't talkin' no pets
Bruck down a nine in flake
And whip it in Zs
Let it dry then put it in pebs
Cats dem call for the meds

TT flake, twenty-three on a two-ie
Jakes just passed, hope they don't do a uey
OT, I don't like doin' deals like Louie
Bad B like boujee, upsuh with two G's, like Gucci
Pour kettle water on it, watch it start bubblin'
Straight drop, I ain't doublin'
Use your chest, stop mumblin'
Bro, I'm booky
I'll take your food if my belly starts rumblin'
They rap about bootings, they ain't blammed nobody
Hold that properly when I bang that dotty
I put sniff in a 'rex, and I slang that Bobby
TT make it bling, always answering my hottie
Left my worker in the trap
While I flew to the town on pedal bike
Just to sweep some more cats
They ain't seein' no racks
I'm in and out of the trap
I left the door on the latch
When I add it up, take a oner off with the shorts
I'm a 0-1-1 but most of them are noughts
Fuck jail; fuck Jakes; fuck courts
Drilla got twelve cah he turned somethin' corpse, crasses
What's all the hate for?
Is it 'cause I'm makin' dough?
That hate only push me to make more
I smash b, whip coke, smoke loud
Whip a Z, twenty six back, no doubt

Feds know my face from the days when I sold buj'
Comfy in my ends
And I got beef in my own hood
In the trap
Left cracks on the floor like Hulk would
Gyally said she like me
'Cause I'm sweet and I'm so hood
Hospital, nose full of tubes
Got yourself shanked up
Cah your bros wanna screw
MSkum in the back
That's a problem for these yutes
Ten toes, what? Where?
Don't get run out of your shoes
I get busy on my own
I get busy on the roads
Keep on braggin' 'bout them Z's
'Til I clean out your home
Gotta keep my face down cah Sini's kinda known
Cah my hood's like a jungle, no Indiana Jones
Me and F was in the trap
You was busy gettin' plaits
When your bro got touched
You didn't even chip in for a strap
When I hopped off the ped
They did a one-hundred-metre track
If Huncho never stabbed it
Then it's probably my nigga, Dappz
Took you twenty shank wounds
Now you're only bringin' waps?29Embed
