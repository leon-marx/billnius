Alone Lyrics
B Squared beats
Oh (Oh-woah)
Oh-woah
Tell me what, what you see
Will-A-Fool

Uh, you ever feel like you worthless? (Graah)
Like you ain't worth shit? (Yeah)
And I know that I ain't perfect
But you know that I'm worth it, uh (Yeah)
Tryna find somethin' to do with my time (Time)
Ease my pain, get you off of my mind
Three cell phones, I been on my grind
No more love means no more lies
And I tried, yeah
Lord knows I tried (Yeah, yeah)
Smokin' dope back to back, I'm fried (Fried)
Thuggin' for three days, see the pain in his eyes (Yeah)
Tryna get over pride (Yeah, yeah)
And I'm here to let 'em know (Let 'em know, oh, I gotta let 'em know, yeah)
Uh, if you love 'em, don't let 'em go (Let 'em go, tell me, why would you ever let 'em go?)
I found your headband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
I don't get waves of missin' you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes (Yeah, yeah)
Remember all of the times on Pinellas Point Drive
Actin' like you was fine, a broken heart in disguise
Loved the nigga to death, even though I was tellin' lies
The day that we run away, all the stars align
It's the same old thing (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's the same old song (Gang, yeah)
One day you're here, next day, you're gone (Gone)
All of the fussin', all of the fights
All the early mornings and the long nights
All the who's right's, and all the who's wrong (Woah, yeah, yeah)
Just to end up alone (All alone, ended alone)
Just to end up alone (All alone, just to end up alone)
Just to end up alone (All that work, all that time)
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be
Don't leave me alone

Ayy, let me hear that, Chino
Let me see where I'm at with that bih
Grrah, grrahYou might also likeEmbed
