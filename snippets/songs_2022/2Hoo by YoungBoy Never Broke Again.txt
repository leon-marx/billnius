2Hoo Lyrics
In this bitch, this lil' Top tho

Three-sixty, Im with it, she eat it, I lick it
Movin fast, Im on her ass
Okay, I get it
Grab her hair, she throw it back, Im hittin it, givin her the business
Murder scene, I stick two up her body, know I had to kill it
Im with it, aint finished, lets get it, ooh
I grip her body, make sure I got it
Hold on, I aint through
Cant figure what you do to me, know what Ima do to you
Say she cant get enough of me, say I cant get enough too-hoo, hoo
Now turn around, I beat it down, she say she wan go some rounds
I ask How many? She say Two-hoo, hoo
I keep her round
I asked her can she bring some friends?
Smoke out the pound
She asked How many? I say Two
Say she like it, ooh, ooh
Then I start to hittin' it bad
She get on top, she milly rock, I vision lots amounts of cash
Swim in her waist but it's okay
Tryna give a lots amounts of ass
Shoot on her face, I did that bad
She say "Bad, bad"

Steady run away and I dont like it
I just wanna hit it up on my own way, so please dont fight it
How many? I say Two
Want expedition with yo friend and you
Hope you with it and not trippin on me like you way too cool

Three-sixty, Im with it, she eat it, I lick it
Movin fast, Im on her ass
Okay, I get it
Grab her hair, she throw it back, Im hittin it, givin her the business
Murder scene, I stick two up her body, know I had to kill it
Im with it, aint finished, lets get it, ooh
I grip her body, make sure I got it
Hold on, I aint through
Cant figure what you do to me, know what Ima do to you
Say she cant get enough of me, say I cant get enough too-hoo, hoo
Now turn around, I beat it down, she say she wan go some rounds
I ask How many? She say Two-hoo, hoo
I keep her round
I asked her can she bring some friends?
Smoke out the pound
She asked How many? I say Two

Im thuggin and she love it, never wit the fussin
I got two in here at once, I hope that they dont go to scufflin
She wan two, she dont want one
Dont got no rubber, Im in trouble
But got four, not two, Im clutchin
She just waitin on me to fuck her
Like Hugh Hefner, this a house of business
So don't bring no problems
Taking pictures, better not let me find out 'bout it
Give you my location, I'm gon drop 'em then I pop ya
You my lil' baby, that's your sister, hope you got it
I want two, I don't know about you

Three-sixty, Im with it, she eat it, I lick it
Movin fast, Im on her ass
Okay, I get it
Grab her hair, she throw it back, Im hittin it, givin her the business
Murder scene, I stick two up her body, know I had to kill it
Im with it, aint finished, lets get it, ooh
I grip her body, make sure I got it
Hold on, I aint through
Cant figure what you do to me, know what Ima do to you
Say she cant get enough of me, say I cant get enough too-hoo, hoo
Can't get enough, I got two in here at once
I hope that they don't go to scufflin'
I say, ooh, ooh
Aint got no rubber, Im in trouble
But got four, not two, Im clutchin
She just waitin on me to fuck her3Embed
