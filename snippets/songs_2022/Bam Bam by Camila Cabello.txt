TranslationsEspanolPortuguesDeutschFrancaisBam Bam Lyrics
You said you hated the ocean, but you're surfin' now
I said I'd love you for life, but I just sold our house
We were kids at the start, I guess we're grown-ups now, mmm
Couldn't ever imagine even havin' doubts
But not everything works out, no

Now I'm out dancin' with strangers
You could be casually datin'
Damn, it's all changin' so fast
Asi e' la vida, si
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Asi e' la vida, si
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin', but now I'm dancin'
He's all over me (Goza)

Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (Asi e' la vida)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam

It's been a hell of a year, thank God we made it out
Yeah, we were ridin' a wave and trying not to drown
And on the surface, I held it together
But underneath, I sorta came unwound
Where would I be? You're all that I need
My world, baby, you hold me down
You always hold me down
You might also like
Well, I've been the breaker and broken
Every mistake turned to moments
Wouldn't take anything back

Asi e' la vida, si (Asi e')
Yeah, that's just life, baby
Yeah, love came around and it knocked me down
But I'm back on my feet
Asi e' la vida, si
Yeah, that's just life, baby
I was barely standin', but now I'm dancin'
She's all over me (He's all over me)

Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam (Ahi, ahi)
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam, bam-bam
Ba-da, bam-bam-bam-bam
