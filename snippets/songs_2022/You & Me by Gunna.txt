TranslationsEspanolyou & me Lyrics
Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about, 'bout you and me
Put it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know about this here

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about, 'bout you and me (Taurus)
Keep it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know
What people say, 'bout you and me
They don't know
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll fuck you right, I will, I'll fuck you right, I will
This pussy tight, but I don't care, I eat it like five star meal
Can I trust you to take the wheel?
Can I put you inside my whip?
Oh, baby, you fine-fine
They don't know that we wine, dine
Call your phone like a hotline
We go up and get sky high
Mix together like tie-dye
I get selfish with you, babe, you mine, all mine
Keep it solid, don't tell lies
She one thousand with me and the best of all time
Rockin' water with alkaline
Eliantte, that VS shine
Bend it over, I broke her spine
Dig it in and I'm deep inside
Know it's wrong but it feel so right
And my lil' baby sweet as pie
Don't believe it, it's all in yo' mind
I can tell you don't know about mine

Don't listen to what people say
They don't know about, 'bout you and me
Keep it out your mind 'cause it's jealousy
They don't know

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll fuck you right, I will, I'll fuck you right, I will
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll fuck you right, I will, I'll fuck you right, I will
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll fuck you right, I will, I'll fuck you right, I will
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll fuck you right, I will, I'll fuck you right, I will

Heard about my past, things I used to do
The games I used to play, the girls that didn't last
I know what's on your mind, think I'm doin' wrong
Can I say what is real? You are the only one10Embed
