Mm-mm-mm

I'm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain (Hit switch, pull curtain)
And I been waitin' so long
Now I gotta resurface (I gotta resurface)
And yeah, we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin' (Burnin', burnin', burnin')
'Cause I been feelin' cooped up (Yeah)
I been fuckin' cooped up (Mm-mm-mm)
Yeah, I'm off the Bud Light, not the bourbon (Mm)
I might chop the roof off the Suburban (Skrrt)
Tried to Bia Nice Guy, John Terzian (Wow)
'Til I started throwin' up in your Birkin (Ooh)
Then I woke up in the mornin' (I woke up in the)
Police showed up at my door with a warrant (Fuck that shit)
I remember flushin' somethin' down the toilet (Flush, flush)
Guess you gotta let me off with a warnin'
Return of the Mack (Ah)
Feelin' like an outcast, I'm the only guy in slacks
That'll cost you three stacks (Three stacks, three stacks)
Now you're savin' that check, why you takin' my swag?
Can you give me that back?
Gucci my Prada, Miyake (Ooh)
Louis, Bottega, and Tommy
All of these things on my body, let's party (Ah, ah, ah)

I'm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain (Hit switch, pull curtain)
And I been waitin' so long
Now I gotta resurface (I gotta resurface)
And yeah, we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin' (Burnin', burnin', burnin')
'Cause I been feelin' cooped up (Yeah)
I been fuckin' cooped up (Cooped up, mm-mm-mm)

Shit, gotta pull up
Pull up, I'ma pull up
I pull up, ayy
Got black minx all on the rug, woah, woah
Got hella hoes poppin' drugs, woah, woah
In every hood, they show us love, woah, woah
Partner in crime with me while we whippin' in the spaceship
Got it out the pavement, now we gettin' payment
Everybody 'round me gettin' money, it's too contagious
Kept it solid, now we real rich to they amazement
I pulled up the Black Badge 'cause it was cleaner
I 'member I was just posted up with the demons
And Posty took me on my first damn tour dates
He had me rockin' every night, sold out arenas
A project nigga, I never thought I would see shit
I tried to tell you, you prolly wouldn't believe us

I'm about to pull up
Hit switch, pull curtain (Hit switch, pull curtain)
And I been waitin' so long
Now I gotta resurface (I gotta resurface)
And yeah, we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin' (Burnin', burnin', burnin')
'Cause I been feelin' cooped up (Yeah)
I been fuckin' cooped up (Cooped up, mm-mm-mm)
'Til the daylight come, 'til the daylight come
I got Sake in my tummy, cigarette in my lungs
It's eleven in the mornin' and we still ain't done
And I'm still that bitch, so what?

Yeah, we 'bout to toast up
All that bread that we burnin' (Burnin', burnin', burnin')
'Cause I been feelin' cooped up (Yeah)
I been fuckin' cooped up (Cooped up, mm-mm-mm)15Embed
