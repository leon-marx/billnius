Treat Me Lyrics
You know you go broke tryna handle me
Take it from someone who know how to handle me
I'ma need that real grown kinda energy, uh
Do you know? Do you know?
'Cause you're dealing with a lot of competition
You're gonna have to do a lotta ass-kissin'
You know I got someone with the time to listen
Tell me boy, do you know? Do you know?

I, I, I, I, I
Do it every night
Show me a good time
You can too, I let you
Try, try, try, try, try, oh
This right here your chance
Learn it from the best
Here's what you gotta do
Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' verywhere)
Yah, you know I do it right
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh, I make me feel so nice
(Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Love me like I love me completely and deeply, now
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh, oh, oh, treat me like I treat me
(Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere)

Exceptional
You know anything less is unacceptable
Don't get me wrong, I'm flexible
But only in all the ways my legs can go
Confessional, I'm skeptical
'Cause being on my level is difficult
You better wake up and put me on a pedestal
I bet you know, I know, do you know?
You might also like
I, I, I, I, I
Do it every night
Show me a good time
You can too, I let you
Try, try, try, try, try, oh
This right here your chance (Chance)
Learn it from the best (The best)
Here's what you gotta do

Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Yeah, you know I do it right
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh, I make me feel so nice (Oh, I make me feel so)
(Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Love me (Love me) like I love me completely and deeply, now
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
(Booty, booty, booty, booty, rockin' everywhere)
Oh, oh, oh
(Rockin' everywhere, rockin' everywhere)
Treat me like I treat me (Treat me, baby)
Yeah, you know I do it right (Yeah, you know I do it right)
Treat me like I treat me (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, I make me feel so nice (Oh, oh, oh, I)
Treat me like I treat me (Oh, oh, oh)
Love me like I love me completely and deeply, now (Oh)
Now (Oh)
Treat me like I treat me8Embed
