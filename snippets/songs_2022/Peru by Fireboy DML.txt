Eh eh eh
Yeahh yeah

Omoge no be so
Girl you won capture my soul
Omoge no be so
Make we won wombolobo
Peru para
Peru peru para

Tonight in Jozi
Im in Jozi
Mo n korin fun wan, wan jo si
Im not playing with you
Im not joking
My third album is loading
Mi okin fagbo but Im on molly
Im on duty but Im on lowkey
They wan do me, they wan do me
They wan do me gan, they wan do me

Wo ni won wa mi
Wo ni won wa mi
Im in San Francisco jamming
Wo ni won wa mi
Wo ni won wa mi
I just flew in from Miami

Peru para
Peru peru para
Im loooo
Even Peru don dey para

She say she like my tunes
She say me I never see a guy like you
Shey you like my tattoo
Girl me I want to be inside you
She is my woman
Inside puna sweet like sugar
In my new van
Come to me I dey swim like tuna

Wo ni won wa mi
Wo ni won wa mi
Im in San Francisco jamming
Wo ni won wa mi
Wo ni won wa mi
I just flew in from Miami

Peru para
Peru peru para
Im loooo
Even Peru don dey para
Peru para
Peru peru para
Im loooo
Even Peru don dey paraEmbed
