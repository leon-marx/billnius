down home Lyrics
I bet you're up there, makin' new friends
I'm pretty sure you're lovin' every minute
If there's a golden pond full of fish
I bet you already caught everything in it
I bet you're makin' everybody laugh with your jokes
I know you're holdin' nothin' but the best kind of hope
Shinin' a light up there with a big old smile, yeah
And meanwhile

Down home
Oh, you know Mama's still cookin'
Them down home grits
I promise I'm workin'
With this guitar about as hard as I can
I met a girl, bought a house, I put a nice little paymnt
Down home
Is still where my hart is
This down home kid is just how you left him
I still hate that you're gone
I wish you were here
But I hope I'm making you proud
'Cause I know you're up there lookin' down home
There ain't a day down here that goes by
That I don't climb up in my F-150
On a backroad bumpin' Charley Pride
Yeah, every song keeps you right here with me
I got a daughter now, I really wish you'd've met
And she's walkin' now but I know you see every step
I wear the number fifteen every chance I get
So when you're lookin' through the clouds, Daddy
You can bet

That down home
Oh, you know Mama's still cookin'
Them down home grits
I promise I'm workin'
With this guitar about as hard as I can
I met a girl, bought a house, I put a nice little payment
Down home
Is still where my heart is
This down home kid is just how you left him
I still hate that you're gone
I wish you were here
But I hope I'm makin' you proud
'Cause I know you're up there lookin' down home
Oh, down home
You might also like
Daddy, don't you worry (Down home, oh no)
'Cause everything, everything, everything's good (Down home)
Down home (Down home), yeah
And oh-oh, yeah

Down home
Oh, you know Mama's still cookin'
Them down home grits
I promise I'm workin'
With this guitar about as hard as I can
I met a girl, bought a house, I put a nice little payment
Down home
Is still where my heart is (Oh, down home)
This down home kid is just how you left him (Oh yeah)
I still hate that you're gone
I wish you were here
But I hope I'm makin' you proud
'Cause I know you're up there lookin' down home
Down home
Down home, yeah

We still miss you
We still miss you
We miss you down homeEmbed
