Santa Claus Is Coming to Town Lyrics
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

You'd better watch out
You'd better not cry
You'd better not pout
I'm telling you why

Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice

Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
(Be good for goodness sake)

Oh, you'd better watch out (Watch out)
You'd better not cry (Woo-hoo)
Better not pout
I'm telling you why

Oh! Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town (Woo-hoo)
(Woo-hoo, woo-hoo)
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Little tin horns, and little toy drums
Rooty-toot-toot, and rump-a-tum-tums
Curly-haired dolls, that tootle and coo
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too

Oh! Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
One more time now
Santa Claus is comin' to town, oh yeah
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town1Embed
