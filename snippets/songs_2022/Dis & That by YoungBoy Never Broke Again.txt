(Mommy, India got the beats)
(Leor, light it up)
Let me tell you, what?
(Thanks Yakree)
Fuck

They aint let me in this bitch in a lil' minute and Im bootin' up
They done let me in this bitch with all my niggas and Im tooled up
These niggas got me fucked up
"YoungBoy, they got you fucked up?"
These niggas never touched us
Bitch, you know Ill get you busted up
They like This that, this that, please get off my dick now
You know that I dont give no fuck, get mad and get yo' bitch gone
Im like Big stacks, big stacks, Its lil' YoungBoy and Im rich now
All those gunners trail me 'round, while Im ridin' through the town

Say, Lil' daddy, calm down, 'fore I whoop you like my son, bitch
Ridin' 'round on that dumb shit, hundred round drums in these sticks
Im tooted up, Im booted up, Im out my body in this bitch
Stuntin' for that ho, you'll make a nigga leave yo' body in front that bitch
Clean I'm Fendi down, nothing but gang pendants 'round
Soon as I touch the city, they know its murder in town
Yeah, I dont fuck around, bitch, I say Bump it down
Draw down with them dirty sticks and go to dumpin' 'round this bitch
I cannot stop buckin', bitch, Im chewed up, drugs inside my body
Im leanin' hard off that R, they a think Im on the Roxy
They know lil brotha ready for to spin, call 'em kamikaze (Spin)
Suicidal slime, if you don't stop 'em, know that he gon' pop ya
Quando 'bout that jump out gang (Yeah)
Make these niggas hold up
Nothin' but green flags around this bitch
These pussy niggas froze up (Gang)
They only zipped one of us up
Left five his brothers with they toes up
Pussy nigga with all that rapping, and he know what up
Play with me its going down, nigga
My mama say Its thug life in that Nawf
Thats where I'm found, nigga
My young nigga caught up in that drug life, he distributin' them pounds, nigga
Hold on, bow, yeah, let me do my dance for all these hoes
Hold on, bow, nigga, money fannin', then I touch my toes

They done let me in this bitch with all my niggas and Im tooled up

You know that I dont give no fuck, get mad and get yo' bitch gone

They aint let me in this bitch in a lil' minute and Im bootin' up
They done let me in this bitch with all my niggas and Im tooled up
