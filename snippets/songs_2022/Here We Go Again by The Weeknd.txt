Strike a pose with my kinfolk
Front page of the billboards
Suit and tie and cigar smokes
Macallan shots 'til it burn throats
We still celebratin' Super Bowl
Catalog lookin' legendary
Ring froze like it's February
XO, that's a mercenary
A quarter bill on an off-year
Used to sing on lofts
But now we cruisin' on a yacht, we clear, yeah
Said you wanted your boyfriend jealous with a couple pics
And you didn't expect to fall for me once you got this dick
The city dark, city dangerous
Your girlfriend's tryna pair you with somebody more famous
But instead you ended up with someone so basic, faceless
Someone to take your pictures and frame it
And my new girl, she a movie star
My new girl, she a movie star
I loved her right, make her scream like Neve Campbell
But when I make her laugh, swear it cures my depressin' thoughts
'Cause baby girl, she a movie star
Baby girl, she a movie star
I told myself that I'd never fall
But here we go again
Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again

Although this love is strong to me
Some things can change, go wrong with me
We don't know how it's gonna be
Forever is too long to me
We don't need the government involved because we like to touch
We don't need no damn religion tellin' us that we in love
But if we did crush down the road, spendin' lawyer fees up
Pen and pad gon' save my ass if these feelings freeze up
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup
You gon' sign this prenup, you gon' sign this prenup

Ooh
Here we go again
Life's a dream
'Cause it's never what it seems
But you'd rather love and lost with tears
Than never love at all
So here we go again
