Heart on Fire Lyrics
Roosevelt Road was too rough for my old truck
Yeah, shed shake and shed shimmy like Elvis singin All Shook Up
You cant blame a boy for going drive-it-like-you-stole-it fast
With your window down, brown hair, blowin look at me like that

A turned-up radio but the static was heavy
Couldnt make out any words but take me to the levee
That look on your face was full of wild desire
Soakin my soul in gas and settin my heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire

I dont have a single second thought that doesnt have you in it
To feel those flames again, I'd go back in a New York minute
I miss the freedom of you dancin' on the bow of your daddys old boat
When my spirit starts sinkin, that picture always make it float, baby

We werent old enough to drink, but we damn sure did it
Hat turned backward, singin Paradise City
That look on your face was full of young desire
Soakin my soul in gas and settin my heart on fire

Heart on fire

Turned-up radio but the static was heavy
Couldnt make out any words but take me to the levee
That look on your face was full of wild desire
Soakin my soul in gas and settin my heart on fire
You might also like
Heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire

Roosevelt Road was too rough for my old truck
Yeah, shed shake and shed shimmy like Elvis singin All Shook Up
Heart on fire
Heart on fire
Heart on fire1Embed
