No Deal Lyrics
(That wasn't funny)
(But she laughed so hard, she almost cried)
(They're countin' months they've been together)
(Almost forty-nine)
(Yo, Sam, this shit heat)
(He's making fun of how she acted 'round the holidays)
(Damn, Dawson)
(She wears a ring, but they tell people that they're not engaged)
(They met in class for metaphysical philosophy)
(He tells his friends, "I like her)
('Cause she's so much smarter than me")
(They're having talks about their futures until 4 A.M)
(And I'm happy for thm)
(But I wanna feel all that love and emotion)
(Be that attachd to the person I'm holdin')
(Someday I'll be falling without caution)
(But for now, I'm only people watchin')
Yeah, uh
Thinkin' about my life and how far a nigga came
Thinkin' about my life and mistakes a nigga made
Steady duckin' the reaper, everybody got a day (Grrah)
Hopefully, I'll be ready for it (Yeah, yeah)
Uh, I told 'em my dreams, they ain't believe this
I can't lie, even I couldn't of seen this
I just was on the bus stop, gettin' high out of my brain
Headphones in, listenin' to Kevin Gates sayin'
"Shooting star, shooting star"
Rapper with a pistol, that made me a shooting star
Now we all across the globe, three hundred thousand dollar shows
We wasn't 'posed to get this far
This shit so crazy how these hoes tryna plot on me (Tryna plot on me)
These niggas hatin', want my spot, sendin' shots at me
Know I fuck with Sosa, Ghetto, Spec and Tee
Boy, you must ain't know them boys gon' park the car, jump out on feet
Won't you pay a nigga back for saving 'ya life
I don't know yet but I'm a make it right
I'm tryna ball, these niggas tryna take my life
I'll tell you what'll make a gangster change his life
Go to sleep with millions in his bank
Wake up in the morning, see his daughter face
Just as broke as a joke, when we was down, we was fine (Youngin')
Start achievin' his dreams now my life on the line
Tell the label, "No deal," I need twenty every time
I ain't comin' to Europe if I can't bring my .45
Tell the label, "No deal," I need twenty every time
I ain't coming to Paris if I can't bring my .45 (Oh, woah)

Ayy
Tell the label, "No deal"
I'm fine, I can't come to Rolling Loud if I can't bring fire
You know, I need my fire for these fuck niggas
I need my fire for these fuck niggas (Yeah)
I need my fire for these fuck niggas, I see now
I see now, I need my fire for these fuck niggas (Grrah)
No deal (Baow, baow, baow, baow)
No, no deal
(No, no, no, no)
(No, no)3Embed
