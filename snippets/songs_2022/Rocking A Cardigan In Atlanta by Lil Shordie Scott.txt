Rocking A Cardigan in Atlanta Lyrics
I wanna take a pic with Cardi B inside my cardigan
Niggas know I'm late, they call me Shordie, Mr. Tardy Man
I just smoke my weed and fuck these hoes, I'm not no party man
Hit the plug and check that gas and take off in that Harley, man

I see a thotty with a booty
Bitch, I'm fresh as hell, I got on Rick Owens mixed with Ksubi (Yessir)
Call me Shordie, A.K.A Mr. Stepper
Mr. Frat Boy, get it going, I am a rapper
I can't stand niggas, get the fuck away from me (Okay)
I don't fuck with you, so why the fuck you play with me? (Okay)
You is not my gang, so you can't never stay with me (No way)
Every time I step outside that house, that K with me (Hey)
Play with the gang, you get whacked
I cannot fuck with these rappin'-ass niggas, they cap
I'm in the stu' with your bitch
She sucking my dick with the MAC in the back
You said she was loyal, what happened to that? (What happened to that? What happened?)
Hey, what happened to bitch?
I got the stock and the K with the kick
I'm in the party, the Glock on my dick
Hey, she wanna fuck 'cause I'm him (Him)
If a nigga play with me, that thirty on his temp'
Ayy, I'm him and my bitch her, I am him and my bitch her
What is one thing you wanna do before you leave this Earth?
I wanna take a pic with Cardi B inside my cardigan
Niggas know I'm late, they call me Shordie, Mr. Tardy Man
I just smoke my weed and fuck these hoes, I'm not no party man
Hit the plug and check that gas and take off in that Harley, manYou might also like2Embed
