I Know It Lyrics
(B Squared Beats)
(Will-A-Fool)
Yeah, oh, yeah
What a world, yeah, yeah
You know
Never see me when I move, a thief in the night (Head on straight, you feel me?)
Head on a swivel, you know?
Eyes wide open
Yeah
Never see me when I move, a thief in the night (Thief in the night)
Five-percent tint on the rentals, right in plain sight
I know shit is not the same, gotta be different
I know nothing lasts forever, savin' more than I been spendin'
I know these niggas hatin' and these hoes messy
Know I gotta pay my taxes, I can't go out like Wesley
Know I got a team dependin' on me
Every night I have nightmares of 'em sentencin' me
I know nobody untouchable, my pistol with me
You know I met this cold world when I was seventeen
I know I gotta stay focused, keep my business in order (Yeah)
Be there for my family and be there for my daughters
I know niggas ain't got money but these niggas wanna beef
Niggas can't even compare but these niggas wanna compete
Know death around the corner, but it better not touch my street
My youngin' from Daytona, he gon' hit the road for me (Grrah-pop-pop-pop)
That's how it 'posed to be

Still on the grind (Yeah, yeah)
So many things in his brain at one time (Yeah, yeah)
Wake up in the morning and get straight to the business
In the back of my mind, I hear the clock tickin'
I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
Know it, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
I know it (I know it), I know it (I know it)
And I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
Know it, I know it, I know it, I know it, I know it
I know it (I know it, yeah), I know it
You might also like
I know it
I know it
I know the clock tickin', yeahEmbed
