Slow Down Summer Lyrics
Your shades on my dashboard, shoes on my floorboard
Lived in that old Chevrolet
We were two Roman candles, too hot to handle
Two hearts that couldn't be tamed

Yeah, we knew what was comin
And laughed it off like it was nothin'
Oh, but time kept on runnin' and runnin away
Yeah, what can I say?
We had our hopes up and the windows down
Fallin' fast in a one-lane town
Tangled up with your lips on mine
Never seen a brighter green in those eyes and
I put my jacket on your shoulder
Wishin' the weather wasn't gettin' colder
Lettin' you go, holdin' onto each other
Closin' our eyes, sayin, "Slow down, summer"
(Slow down, summer)

I was beggin those leaves, "Don't go changin on me"
"Friday night lights, stay away"
But the Fourth of July was just smoke in the sky
And our sunburns were startin' to fade

Yeah, we knew what was comin'
And laughed it off like it was nothin'
Oh, but time kept on runnin and runnin' away

Yeah, those were the days
We had our hopes up and the windows down
Fallin' fast in a one-lane town
Tangled up with your lips on mine
Never seen a brighter green in those eyes and
I put my jacket on your shoulder
Wishin' the weather wasn't gettin' colder
Lettin' you go, holdin' onto each other
Closin' our eyes, sayin', "Slow down, summer"
(Slow down, summer)
You might also like
Why couldn't you slow down, summer?
Just wait a minute, we weren't finished
Can we just hold onto each other?
Take me back to the beginnin', oh
Slow down, summer
Slow down, summer

Yeah, those were the days
We had our hopes up and the windows down
Fallin' fast in a one-lane town
Tangled up with your lips on mine
Never seen a brighter green in those eyes and
I put my jacket on your shoulder
Wishin' the weather wasn't gettin' colder
Lettin' you go, holdin' onto each other
Closin' our eyes, sayin', "Slow down, summer"

Oh (Slow down, summer)
Slow down, summer, yeah
Why couldn't you slow down, summer?
Why couldn't you slow down?
Slow down
Why couldn't you slow down, summer?1Embed
