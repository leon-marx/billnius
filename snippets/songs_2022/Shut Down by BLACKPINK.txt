BLACKPINK in your area, eh-oh
BLACKPINK in your area, eh-oh

    
    
  drip, drip, drip, freeze 'em on sight
Shut it down, what, what, what, what?
    
     
  pedal, we go two-zero-five
Shut it down, uh-uh, uh-uh
    , don't trip, baby
  , just sit, baby
Praying for my downfall, many have tried, baby
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
    shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
It's black and it's pink once the sun down
When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
    shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Keep watchin' me shut it down

Nah, you don't wanna be on my bad side
That's right, I'm slidin' through
Bunch of wannabes that wanna be me
Me three, if I was you
Been around the world, pearls on ya girl
VVS's, we invested, uh
Need a lesson, see the necklace, see these dresses
We don't buy it, w request it, uh
A rock star, a pop star, but rowdier
Say by to the paparazzi, get my good side, I'll smile for ya
Know it ain't fair to ya, it's scarin' ya like what now?
BLACKPINK in your area, the area been shut down
It's a shutdown
You might also like
    , don't sleep, baby
  , ain't cheap, baby
Stay in your own lane 'cause I'm 'bout to swerve
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom

When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
    shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
It's black and it's pink once the sun down
When we pull up, you know it's a shutdown
    shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Keep watchin' me shut it down

Shut it down (Eh-oh), BLACKPINK in your area
Shut it down (Eh-oh), woah, woah, woah, woah
Shut it down (Eh-oh), BLACKPINK in your area
Keep talkin', we shut you down48Embed
