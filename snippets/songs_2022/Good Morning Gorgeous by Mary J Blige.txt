Good Morning Gorgeous Lyrics
Ooh
Ooh, ooh, ohh, ah
Ooh, ooh

It's so hard just holding on
Ain't even picking up my phone
It's hard enough to be, hard enough to sleep
Hard enough to be alone
I'm just tryna move along
Sometimes, I do and then I don't
You tell me what I'm doing wrong
Tell myself that it ain't healthy
Second guessing, it don't help me
I'm so tired of feeling empty
Dry my eyes, it's time to fight
It seems like I'm always against me
Seems like this is never ending
And I refuse to let it end me
Mentally (Mhm), spiritually (Oh), physically
I need my peace, yeah, oh
I need my pace, oh, oh, oh-oh
I wake up evry morning and tell myself
"Good morning, gorgeous"
Sometimes, you gotta look in the mirror and say
"Good morning, gorgeous"
No one else can make me feel this way
Good morning, gorgeous
Good morning, gorgeous
Good morning, gorgeous
Oh

All the times that I hated myself (Yeah)
All the times that I wanted to be someone else (Yeah)
All the times that I should've been gentle with me
All the times that I should've been careful with me
Why did I hate myself? (Why did I hate me?)
So intensely
Lord, help me

I wake up every morning and tell myself
"Good morning, gorgeous"
Sometimes, you gotta look in the mirror and say (Yeah)
"Good morning, gorgeous"
No one else (Oh, yeah) can make me feel this way
Good morning, gorgeous (Oh, good morning)
Good morning, gorgeous (Good morning, good morning, good morning)
Good morning, gorgeous
Oh-oh, oh-oh

I ain't talkin' 'bout getting no hair and make up (No, no, no)
I'm talkin' about soon as I wake up (Oh, oh) I say "Good morning" (Say good morning)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morning (Good morning)
Good morning, gorgeous (Yeah)

Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
Ay, oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Oh, oh, ohEmbed
