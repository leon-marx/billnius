Keep me up, keep me up, I spy plenty of 'em
I, the biggest in your league and your millennium
I was stackin up my chips so I got plenty of 'em
I was blowin' za to catch my equilibrium
Who want the smoke? (Who want the smoke?) Bet not choke (Bet' not choke)
I made an oath (I made an oath) to keep it afloat (To keep it afloat)
We made a toast (We made a toast), doin' the most (Doin' the most)
To doin' the most (Doin' the most), to doin' the most (Doin' the most)
Need to run it back, we need to run it back
Sombody hold my back cause Im comin' in full attack
We need to run it back, we need to run it back (Yah)
Somebody hold my back cause I'm comin' in full attack (Yeah)
Please come for me, ain't nobodys on this level
At least you had to know it, but you end up callin' the devil (Let's pray)
I know you pray to God when you want somethin' from me
I know you pray to God when you want somethin' from me
I know you pray to God when you want some

I smell the smoke (Yeah, I smell)
Up in U-T-O (U-T-O)
Down to P-I-A, all these G-I-As
You know I love to tote, keep that peyote roll (Ooh)
And when Flame need to spark, she pull up
That head dumb, even though though that whip she in smart (Whip it)
Side, keep her head start (It's lit)
Side, bounce on the top
You know they prayin' that you drop, you know I'm prayin' that you not (No)
And never pray for the knots (No)
You know that come with the spot, you know that come when you're hot (Hot)
Don't get caught dancin' with the devil, don't leave out with the fire (Fire)
Just did this party for some mems who like to one-up the ride
We make the block bleed like a menstrual when we pull out and slide
Back to Utopia, let's ride
I'll be back when I uh (Straight up)

Please come for me, ain't nobody's on this level
At least you had to know it, but you end up callin' the devil (Let's pray)
I know you pray to God when you want somethin' from me
I know you pray to God when you want somethin' from me
I know you pray to God when you want someYou might also like2Embed
