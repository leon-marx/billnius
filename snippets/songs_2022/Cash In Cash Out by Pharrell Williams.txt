Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out

Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out (21)
Ridin' in the car with no keys (Straight up)
Louis V shirt with no sleeves (On God)
Slaughter Gang, nigga, I'm reppin' (21)
Chopper get to preachin', I'm the reverend (21)
Call him New Era, he cappin' (Yeah)
Them the type of niggas I ain't dappin' (On God)
When I book a show, make my backend cashin'
21, Uncle Sam, dawg, I'm taxin'
Ridin' in the coupe and it's a sport (Yeah)
My bodyguard look like a horse (Straight up)
She gon' suck me up like it's a chore (On God)
Took the LaFerrari on a tour (21)
Buy a Richard Mill' when I get bored (Bored)
Put my sidepiece inside a Porsche (A Porsch)
Money turned me into an asshol
I ain't gon' lie, I was used to being poor (21)
I put Chanel on my feet (And what?)
European model got Chanel on my seats
Put me in a third world country in the middle of the slums
I'ma turn it to a million dollar street (On God)
Pharrell made this so it's a million dollar beat (Straight up)
V12, VVS, I fell in love with Vs (Straight up)
Walk in your section, you ain't reppin' 'bout nothin'
My invoice gon' be a million dollar fee (On God)
Hop in a Bentley and slide (And what?)
Reach for my chain and you die (Say what?)
You know my method, I'ma turn your shirt red, man
Then send your ass how high (On God)
Mama got a Benz, she smiled (21)
Then she got a house, she cried (21)
Nigga took the stand, he lied
Held court in the streets and they gave his ass life (Goddamn)
I'm gettin' bigger and bigger (And what?)
Your pockets littler than little (21)
Put a hundred bands on your head
Now they jumpin' up and down playin' monkey in the middle
She swallow all my kids, she a bad babysitter
Kim Jong-Un, in my pants it's a missile
Friend of the family, I hit all the sisters
The mama love me so she hid all my pistols (Straight up)

Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out
Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out (It's Bunnyhop, nigga)
Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out (Let me tell these niggas real quick)

Nah, I ain't heard of that, I hit the beach in a furry hat
She got a guy but she purrin' back, I'm lookin' like, "Where he at?"
Nigga, get out the way (Way), that girl my bae (Hey)
Rock on my hand, nah, this ain't Dwayne (Hey, hey)
This shit neon yellow like pee on it (Hey, hey)
Goin' both sides, yeah, you could say I'm B-I (Hey, hey)
Got whips like slaves, the garage like, "Yee-haw"
Horses, more car keys than a piano
One came with an umbrella like Rihanna
Nigga, let's be honest (Umm), be honest
Track needed life, nigga, so they put me on it (Yeah, yeah)
Nigga, you don't be on what we on, and 2-1 got three Ks (Yeah)
I think he just might put a sheet on it (Yeah, yeah)
Ice so white, motherfucker, you could ski on it (Switch it up)
Look, any stone I'm in, no less than six digits (Yo, what up, stoner?)
Beep go the Rolls, right-side, I sit in it (Come on, man)
Tick go the watch, it came with a dent in it (Come again)
And skrrt on a plane, just me and my bitch in it (Yo)
(They was talkin' 'bout a hundred million, baby)
Just know it's big business
Hands stay full with them racks like hit tennis (Woo)
And no money, phone account, go get interest
Ah (Ah), you got that backend from the backdoor
I got offered two-point-five for the last show (Last show, nigga)
I declined 'cause the stage didn't match my ethos
Hmm, they know that I'm sick with it
Look, player, what you wan' do? (Ooh)
Me, I don't like violence, but the guns do (Ooh)
'Cause that guerilla right there, he gon' hunt you (Ooh)
While me and my bitch countin' stars out the sunroof (Ooh)
And if you wanna flick up, I don't want to (Ooh)
And if you say "No cap", I ain't trust you (Ooh)
Nigga, I'm the headline, you a plus one (Ooh)
I got some brand new thoughts and a new silk scarf
And my bitch do too (Too)
Double R talk and I got like two (Two)
Turbo on that bitch and it hit like zoom (Zoom)
In the mirror, who that nigga? I'm like, "You" (You)
Any time I do something, motherfuckers like, "Oof, oof"
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out (Bunnyhop, bitch)
Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out (Baudelaire, stop fuckin' playin' with me)
Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out (I'll buy one of you niggas)
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash in, cash out, cash in, cash out
Cash out, cash out, cash out, cash out (21, 21)17Embed
