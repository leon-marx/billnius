(Wheezy outta here)

It's Young Wunna and Young Wheezy, man, this shit too easy
Different bitch for every season showin' me they cleavage
I take drugs and feel relaxed, it's like they therapeutic
She text that pussy, I don't call back so she won't think I need it

Made it out the jungle, I ball, ain't got no jumper
Rest in peace to my uncle, never met, but I still love you
Remember that pussy from way back, playin', I pay 'em to pop him
Stayed in the hood where the killers at, made my pillow a chopper
This ain't diamonds you lookin' at and we done updated the roster
You can tell it's a rich nigga posture
Young GunWunna, I'm spittin' it proper
Trappin' at school, I was servin' bags, police was searchin' my locker
Who did your jewelry? It look like brass, one of your bros should've stopped ya
It's Young Wunna and Young Wheezy, man, this shit too easy
Different bitch for every season showin' me they cleavage
I take drugs and feel relaxed, it's like they therapeutic
She text that pussy, I don't call back so she won't think I need it
I stick dick deep inside her throat where it ain't no more breathin'
If I don't post and I go ghost, it's gon' be for a reason
Just got my reading, now my reason's I'm booked out the region
This jewelry cold on me, I'm freezin', no way I'm anemic

Pluto, Pluto, two-door, four-door, man, this shit too easy (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm gon' chop a brick like judo, snatch a Lamborghini (Chop it up)
I got a different bitch for different places, different seasons (I do)
Bitch ain't playin' her position, cuttin' her off, this shit too easy (Super)
I started off smashin' R&B stars right at the bando (Future)
I'm havin' hoes all the way south thinkin' that I abandoned 'em
I'm havin' pimpin' in my blood and I can change the climate (What else?)
I threw the Marni on and took the price up like I designed it (Pluto)
Can't put a presidential on a bitch 'less she give a nigga a menage ('Nage)
That lil' IG bitch ain't shit, fucked her in the car (Car)
Fucked 'round with a side piece, pop out that night in double-R (What up?)
Started talkin' Chinese from all these sticks in the car

It's Young Wunna and Young Wheezy, man, this shit too easy
Different bitch for every season showin' me they cleavage
I take drugs and feel relaxed, it's like they therapeutic
She text that pussy, I don't call back so she won't think I need it
I stick dick deep inside her throat where it ain't no more breathin'
If I don't post and I go ghost, it's gon' be for a reason
Just got my reading, now my reason's I'm booked out the region
This jewelry cold on me, I'm freezin', no way I'm anemicYou might also like12Embed
