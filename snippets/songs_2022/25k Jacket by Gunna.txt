(Wheezy outta here)

I'm pushin P, that's my favorite alphabet
She let me do as I please, I'm an alpha male
When your lawyer paid off, you dont have to tell
When you pay your own bills, you don't have to care
If they noses ain't broke, then they gotta smell
We just got a fresh load, it's a lot in here
That boy on his third strike, get him out of there
Rock 'em out the park
Maybach drive itself so I don't got to park
Upgrade my jewelry, my watch is up to par
We gon' hit the head and watch the body fall
I'm goin ghost, I aint taking no mor calls
That pussy pop, gotta give her her lil' plaus
I want his top, gave the brodie them a job
If I put it up, we forever livin' large
We'll be okay if we make it to tomorrow
Twenty-five thousand for a jacket, wear it once
Niggas actin' like they gettin active, no, they don't
She ain't tryna let me get it crackin', go 'head on
Fast car cuttin' up in traffic, I'm one of those
We ain't nothin' like these other rappers, weirdo
You be tryna save her, she get active, hero
Me and Gunna goin' back to back, here it go

Every day, I'm seeing stars, me and Money Mal
Runnin' that coupe, yeah, the P a push-start
Fresh and I'm blessed, that's why I'm the drip god
Mama ain't stressing, I'm still goin' hard
Bought me two 'Vettes and two Maybachs, what's next?
My whole name worth a check on that gray and black card
Niggas send threats, but I get niggas stretched
You get whacked with that TEC, ain't no need to act hard
Only speak guapanese
AP on my wrist, ain't accepting apologies
So much Prada, you ain't gotta be proud of me
I'm a dog, ho, you don't gotta lie to me
Feel like Pookie, that money keep calling me
Came a long way from shoppin' at Dollar Tree
She keep swallowin', that's why I don't got a seed
Buy Celine and Chanel, girl, you got a C

Twenty-five thousand for a jacket, wear it once
Niggas actin' like they gettin' active, no, they don't
She ain't tryna let me get it crackin', go 'head on
Fast car cuttin' up in traffic, I'm one of those
We ain't nothin' like these other rappers, weirdo
You be tryna save her, she get active, hero
Me and Gunna goin' back to back, here it go
Twenty-five thousand for a jacket, wear it once
Niggas actin' like they get it crackin', no, they don't
She ain't tryna let me get it crackin', go 'head on
Bleedin' while I'm swervin' 'round in traffic, I'm in one of those
We ain't nothin' like you other rappers, weirdos
You be tryna save her, she get active, hero
Me and Baby goin' back to back, here it go6Embed
