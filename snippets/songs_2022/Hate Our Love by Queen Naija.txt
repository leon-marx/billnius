Hate Our Love Lyrics
Ayy, woah, ayy
I can't lie, I wanted you the first time that I saw you (First)
Tried to diss me till you realized I'm someone you could talk to
(For real)
You've been hurt over and over, tell me what has it taught you? (Huh)
Soon as you fell for me, though I had caught you
(Dinner)
Dead your exes, don't let them haunt you
(Haunt you)
You know if they want what's best for them
Then they still want you (Still, yeah)
I know (I know, still), I know (Queen)
Boy, I love you on your worst day
Still see you how I saw you on the first day (First day)
Even though there's times that we ain't seeing eye to eye
Can't imagine spnding holidays or birthdays without you
And the moment I leav
I miss being around you (Yeah, yeah)
And you know you mean well
I never ever doubt you (Yeah, yeah)
We've been through some hell
But I still care about you (Care about you)
Still crazy 'bout you

And I know that they
Hoping and praying on our downfall
Praying on our downfall
Hate to see you walk away
Won't be satisfied until we break up
Hate it when we make up

They hate our love
Want to see us fall
They want to see us fall
They be hating on us
Wishing we would fall
Can't wait to see us fall
You might also like
Every other day is a different story
That they see you out in public with a different shawty (Shawty)
Said you with me for the clout and you don't really love me (Love me)
While we sitting here laughing at all these fucking dummies (Uh)
I don't get it, we stay out the way and stack our money (Oh, oh)
Save in cases and making sure that the kids ain't lacking nothing (Oh, uh, oh)
Always shady on this island, shit's real sunny (Real sunny)
Wouldn't trade it for nothing, eh ayy

And I know that they
Hoping and praying on our downfall
Praying on our downfall
Hate to see you walk away
Won't be satisfied until we break up
Hate it when we make up

They hate our love
Want to see us fall
They want to see us fall
They be hating on us
Wishing we would fall (Woah, woah)
Can't wait to see us fall (Woah)
Ayy, only thing that ever came between us was distance (Straight up)
Only thing you ever asked for me is to keep it consistent
We been working on communication (Woah) and I learned it's not just how you talk though, it's how you listen
I can't be worried 'bout mentions, fuck who ain't us
They can take it how they wanna take it (Take it; Woah)
Tryna break a happy home while we renovate it (Renovate it)
Niggas be irritated, they wish we would end it
But they wasn't there (Woah) in the beginning (Woah)
They wasn't there when your bro died and the pain felt never ending (No)
Mine, I best amend it
Fuck you on the water, only time you was pinned against me (Straight up)
Helped organize my life, before you I was a crass taker (Word, word)
See my future with you 'cause I met you in the past life (Hey)
Mi amor (Woah), can't think of anything in the world that I'm needing more
It's that grandparents rocking chair, fall in love, never needed divorce (No)
In fact, I'll ball with you, only time that we needed a court
You need me, I'm needing you more

They hate our love (For sure)
Want to see us fall
They want to see us fall (Ayy)
They be hating on us (How you gon' hate this?)
Wishing we would (Yeah) fall (Woah)
Can't wait to see us (Woah) fall (Woah)1Embed
