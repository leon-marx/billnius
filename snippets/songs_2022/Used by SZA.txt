TranslationsEspanolPortuguesUsed Lyrics
Yeah, I'll cuss your ass out in a minute

Yes, I've been used to being used like this
Ain't no difference, I'm immortalized in my thoughts
Praise to the most high for protection
Over my most prized possessions
Talkin' 'bout my sanity's at a 6.7
Handin' out poinsettias
To my dead homie mothers, prayin' they feel better
Might get chipped mindin' my business
Might get chipped sharin' my vision
Might as well
Can you tell if it's even worth conversation?
Hit a prayer, do it even work?
All that's for real is forever
Moments stoln taste better
I been ridin', ridin' through this cold world
Thought you had anothr one, went and caught him with ol' girl
I feel like it's over
Something's callin' you, get closer
I'm out of touch, I need a level that's a mile away
Need you once, girl, once, girl
We're goin' out the way
I feel like it's over
Something callin' to get closer

Count my blessings twice as much
Let death stress me too much
Can't hide from pressure, too worried I'm livin' a lie
Can't trust nobody you ain't been broke with
Niggas love to break my focus, bitch, I'm Obi Wan
You caught in the maze, I
Thought it'd be easy to get myself what I needed, but it takes some time
And I'm out of patience, I burned it with you
Can't lose myself to your ego, I wanna say
Love me better when you try less
I don't take much, just need your honesty, oh
Love will work better when you confess
Feelings don't need discussion
Spend my life discoverin' new shit
You might also like
I been ridin', ridin' through this cold world
Thought you had another one, went and caught him with ol' girl
I feel like it's over
Something's callin' you, get closer
I'm out of touch, I need a level that's a mile away
Need you once, girl, once, girl
We're goin' out the way
I feel like it's over
Something callin' to get closer3Embed
