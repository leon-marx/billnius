TranslationsTurkcePortuguesFrancaisEspanolWandered To LA Lyrics
I wandered to L.A., wandered to L.A.
True story

I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Maybe it's the love, maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's because my girlfriend is the plug
Cocaine strums like guitar chords
She loves drugs, she goes hardcore
She's hidin' from the truth, it's under the rug
Maybe it's because, the lies, they fill her up
You see the ghost on her front porch
You see the blood at her front door
We were doin' Xans in the Honda Accord
Lookin' at the things that we couldn't afford
Fantasies became reality, but only for one of us

I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor

Pillowtalkin' 'bout our future and our dreams
Speakin' 'bout how life ain't really as it seems
Reminiscin' 'bout the days you broke my heart
Thankful that we worked it out, we come so far (Come so far)
Say you gotta give me space and let me breathe (Let me breathe)
Say you gotta give me lovin', that I need (That I need)
Still, we gotta focus on the little things (Little things)
Never wanna end up how we used to be (Used to be)
And I don't wanna hear you say-ayy (Say-ayy)
That you don't wanna be with me (Be with me)
This misery needs some company (Company)
That's why I need you, come for me (Come for me)

I wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor
Wandered to L.A., hopin' to explore
Little did I know, I'd find a little more (Ooh)
Love at my hotel room door
From the bed to the hotel room floor

Ooh, I'm the elephant in the room
Ooh, ooh, my nightmares are startin' to come true55Embed
