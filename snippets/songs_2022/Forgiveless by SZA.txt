TranslationsEspanolPortuguesForgiveless Lyrics
Ayy, dawg, yo, yo, yo
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I'm the original G-O-D
Makin young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go da-da-da-da-da-da-da, girls get hype
I'm the funky rap music, stereotyped
When I kill that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin Ason, duck of the disco
Or the disco duck, strictly hip-hop
Baby, baby, I can't stop
I don't care 'bout consequences, I want my lick back
I don't mind who's watchin', get to pushin' your wig back
I dont mind burnin bridges, love my enemies, center peace
Call that bitch my kid, she ain't no kin to me
Gotta watch how you whisper when you around me, though
Give a fuck what you prefer, Im too profound to go
Back and forth with no average dork
It goes spells and sorcery, hug your rosaris
I don't mind competition, it is what it is
You don't mind second fiddle, that's why you a bitch
You dont think for yourslf and that's none of my business
You take it I dish it, I'm genie, three wishes
Better watch how you think out loud if it's 'bout me, though
Got a couple that's outside, they kill about me, though
I don't need nobody help, angels surround me, though
Back and forth it go, it's hard, I know

I thought I told you before
It's not gon' end how you want
Not in the dark anymore
I might forgive it, I won't forget it
I thought I told you before
It's not gon' end how you want
Not in the dark anymore
I might forgive it, I won't forget it
You might also like
This is that old West Coast, East Coast
North Coast, South Coast shit
Yo, yo, this is that ol' boogie nights
Suppose to boogie old type shit
Yo, yo, yo, I wanna give a special shoutout
All my niggas and niggarettes
All race, creed and colors
It's all love, my nigga4Embed
