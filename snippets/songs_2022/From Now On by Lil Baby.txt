TranslationsPortuguesEspanolFrom Now On Lyrics
Yeah, FaceTime, we still talk in codes
I think the feds on every iPhone
No more Polo T-Shirts
Put that shit on everyday from now on

Switchin' up my image, no more pictures with my styrofoam
Why the fuck I keep buyin' these houses if I'm never home?
I'm with gang, they never wrong
Supermodels, I'm stepping on 'em
Search for where my weapon on me
Buy three, four bags in one time
Treat the condo like a trap house
Other spot, a baby compound
Bad bitchs get the run-around
Bruh a trackstar, he run shit down
I mad this shit half of a one pound
I told bro the one band, one sound
She like, "Fuck the club, let's stay in"
Now she gotta get new tape in
Pockets too big, they can't never belittle me
Bae, I'm a hell of a nigga, ain't with the arguing once you deliver
I buy Achilles, the real one
How you the hero but stay with some villains?
I ain't gon' switch on my niggas
I run the game like I'm born with the ball
Youngin ain't corny at all
Five foot nine, but I ain't that small, feel like I'm seven feet tall
Bro ain't stop, he just on pause, he comin' straight when I call him
On FaceTime, we still talk in codes
I think the feds on every iPhone
No more Polo T-Shirts
Put that shit on everyday from now on (Pluto)

Get millions of dollars, walkin' in Prada, drinkin' out styrofoam (Pluto)
Gotta talk in code when you on FaceTime, like the feds on the phone (Oh)
Live a billionaire lifestyle, but I still give beats to your door
Lil' one got the stick, ready to go blitz, lil' one stay on go
Flatline a nigga, one call, pull the pounds up in U-Hauls (Ooh)
Dodgin' a life sentence, poppin' all the shit I talk
I done piped up another nigga bitch, I'm too rich, my fault
I just alley ooped a ho to my dawg, he just slam dunked her (A hundred)
Balling like 'Bron, but now I'm starting to feel like messiah ('Siah)
Codeine drinkin', but I swear the money getting me higher (Higher)
Just told the judge I'm on pills, my mansion got marble (Marble)
Charge a M for a show, still'll send bail to you tomorrow

FaceTime, we still talk in codes
I think the feds on every iPhone
No more Polo T-Shirts
Put that shit on everyday from now on

Everybody can fold but I won't, everybody want it but I don't
I make niggas follow and I lead, I make bitches cum, then I leave
Virgil Maybach be so sweet, we just get 'em, ain't no beef
You can get her back, I can't keep her
We be getting (Shh), that's our secret
Rappers wanna kick it, can't reach me
You and five of y'all niggas can't see me
Really sturdy, a wall, nigga, can't beat me
Akademiks know he ain't as rich as me
Brodie ready to eat for a twenty piece
I ain't got nothin' to say to you mini-mes
Ready to buy a lil' nigga contract
Yeah, yeah, whatever, we on that
Disappearing on 'em, they got weird on me
I'm the fallback king, number one shit
Me and King Pluto, that's a smooth tag team
Gotta live with it, can't wake up from it, this is not a bad dream
Look how life changed, TVs in the shower, used to steal flatscreens

Shh
I know that they listening, fuck 'em
Know not to ask me about nothing
If I ain't somewhere getting money then I'm fuckin' (Fft, fft)
That's that switch sound
I ain't going out without a fight, I'ma tell you that shit now
Whatever I get, I'ma share with my brother
That's how we get down
If you get offended, it is what it is
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta so I gotta snake nowEmbed
