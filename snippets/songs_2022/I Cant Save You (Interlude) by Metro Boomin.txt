TranslationsEspanolTurkceI Cant Save You (Interlude) Lyrics
Ayy
I'm tweakin', I'm geekin'
I'm tweakin', I'm geekin', I can't save no ho
I'm tweakin', I'm geekin'
I'm tweakin', I'm geekin'
I'm tweakin', I'm geekin', I can't save no ho

Met the bitch in the club and you fallin' in love and you knowin' you dead and you wrong
It's whatever, they talkin' about you whenever, don't matter, you dead and you gone
Got the drank and the tank on me
Got the gas in the gar, uh
Metro, Metro, Metro, I got this shit here boomin'
Off the lean, the syrup, the fluid
I'ma tell you, somethin' told me to do it
Put the Perc' in your hand and you blew it
In the room and you know I get to it
Yeah, I get around, nigga, you know it
Play with me wrong, lil' nigga, I'll pull it
I can't save you, I can't save you, I can't save you, I can't
I can't save you, I can't, ayy
I can't save no ho
I can't save you, I can't save you, I can't save you, I can't save you
I can't save you, I can't save you, I can't save these hoes
Trap nigga made it to pro
I can't save no ho
Chauffeur open my door
I can't save you, ho
I can't save you, I can't
I can't save you, I can't save you

Shawty savin' hoes
Told that boy put his cape on
Shawty-shawty savin' hoes
Told that boy put his cape on
Shawty-shawty savin' hoes
Told that boy put his cape on
I can't save these hoes
Most of these hoes don't wanna be saved
Most of these niggas can't identify that most superheroes don't wear a cape
All villains wear a grinYou might also like5Embed
