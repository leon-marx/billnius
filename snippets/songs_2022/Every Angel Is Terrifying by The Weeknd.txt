Ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ah, ah, woah

Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels' order?
Even if they pressed me against their heart, Id be consumed
For beauty is the terror we endure
While we stand and wonder, we're annihilated
Every angel is terrifying
Intense, graphic, sexy, euphoric
Provocative, edgy, thought-provoking
Technically and visually stunning
A compelling work of science fiction
A suspenseful xpose
Cinema like you've nver seen it before
The exotic, bizarre and beautiful world of "After Life"
And this is your invitation to enter
Critics say "After Life" makes your current life look like a total comatose snooze fest
Its action-packed
The future of everyone's fate
