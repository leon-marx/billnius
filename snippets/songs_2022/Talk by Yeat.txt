Yeat concert, Yeat, Yeat (Come on, man)
Man, one of the biggest artists in the world right now
We seen it all, niggas was gettin' tazed
Bitches was poppin' pussy by the front door
Niggas was throwin' chairs, everything was goin' down
Fifty-thousand people, Yeat concert, twizz shit right here
Real twizz shit right here (Real twizzy shit right here)
You guys don't know 'bout it

Jump out at the show (Uh, I-I-I'm working on dying), jump out at the show
Had to change my flow, yeah, had to change the joke (Hey, hey, hey, BNYX)
Potty trained my diamonds, yeah, they smackin' head to to (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, yeah)
"Shh" 'bout what you sayin', yeah, just shut up, let m go (Hey, hey, hey)
Huh, riding in that, B-U-L-L Tonka truck
Riding 'round with these bust-down watches on me, I got my blicky tucked (Hey, hey, hey)
Headin' number one up on these charts, bitch, yeah, it's stuck as fuck
A-A-All we do is just go number one, huh (Hey, hey, hey)
And I just brought in some M's, lil' bitch, it's the first of the month
Riding 'round, I'm in the Cayenne, lil' bitch, I'ma tear up the city, I'm afraid of the sun (Hey, hey, hey)
I went and painted the Benz, I switched shit up, I wanted it done by the dawn
All of my fans is my family, my cult, my brother, my slime, my twizzy, my money (Hey, hey, hey)
I don't give a fuck what you sayin', I don't listen to it, I don't wanna hear 'bout none
And the whip got two R, yeah, Rolls Royce truck, yeah, what the Cullinan bought (Hey, hey, hey)
I'm 'bout to bring this shit back and then wait from the top, it's that time of the month
I'm 'bout to do it again, 'bout to do it again, 'bout to triple the sum (Hey, hey, hey)

How you gon' talk to a rat? (Huh?) How you gon' talk to the feds? (Woo)
How you gon' talk to the shmeds? (Woo) Now you gon' talk to the lead (Huh?)
I don't give a fuck what you sayin', huh, you already heard what I said, huh (Woo)
Yeah, I got big boy diamonds on me, yeah, I got big boy bread (Woo, woo, woo)
And I don't give a fuck 'bout the coupe, yeah, I pop the bitch on Tes', huh (Woo, woo, woo)
You ain't even made no money, yeah, don't make no sense, huh (Woo, woo, woo)
I destroyed the coupe, I'm 'bout to jump out again

Jump out at the show (Uh, I-I-I'm working on dying), jump out at the show
Had to change my flow, yeah, had to change the joke (Hey, hey, hey, BNYX)
Potty trained my diamonds, yeah, they smackin' head to toe (Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, yeah)
"Shh" 'bout what you sayin', yeah, just shut up, let me go (Hey, hey, hey)
