Stone Rolling Lyrics
Pipe that shit up, TnT
SephGotTheWaves

Uh, he's a rolling stone, he's a rolling stone
Long as the wind blows, I'll be long gone (Gone)
He's a rolling stone, he's a rolling stone (He's a, he's a)
Drive with many miles of roads and still can't find my
My home
I remember bein' a kid, I just wanted to travel
On my bed, writin' raps, thinkin' 'bout daddy (My daddy)
Was in my cell, writin' raps, regrettin' my actions (My actions, yeah, yeah)
Like if I make it out this shit, I'm goin' straight to Cali
It's like I know my momma loved him, but I still hate him
Livin' life like a runaway and it's six years later (Later)
I said it and no, I don't regret it (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I just woke up on my tour bus, I don't know where I'm headed
I been out on my own since I turned eighteen
Packed my bags, hit the road, left to chase my dream (My dream)
Loved livin' in the A when people knew me barely
Then my dream came alive, this shit got very scary (Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah)
I got so much and love for Houston, like it raised me
Me and Sauce in a Maybach, gettin' faded
This don't feel right, nah, this shit feel crazy
Clutchin' on my pipe, don't even feel like I made it
I love Las Vegas (Yeah)
But that was before I was famous (Ayy, yeah)
Look, I traveled across the nation, don't matter what state we in (We in)
People stop and stare, and lookin' at us like aliens
I spent some time in Carolina, spent time in Tennessee
Is there a heaven for a G? Where can I go to get some peace?
I wanna settle with my kids, buy a crib by the beach (By the beach, yeah)
No more Percs to ease to pain and no more drank to go to sleep, yeah

Uh, he's a rolling stone (Gang), he's a rolling stone (Life of a rolling stone)
Long as the wind blows, I'll be long gone (Long gone)
He's a rolling stone (Yeah), he's a rolling stone (Yeah, yeah)
Drive with many miles of roads and still can't find my (Can't find my)
My home

Yeah, yeah
My, my home
Life of a rolling stone, huh, life of a rolling stoneEmbed
