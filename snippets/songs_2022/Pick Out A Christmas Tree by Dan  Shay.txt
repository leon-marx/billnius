Pick Out A Christmas Tree Lyrics
Downtown's gettin' busy
People everywhere
Stores are decorated
There's Christmas in the air
Santa's gettin' ready
Kids are countin' down
The only thing left to do right now is

Pick out a Christmas tree
Top shelf in aisle three
We'll tie it to the car
Hey, don't forget the star
And when we get back home
Plug it in and watch it glow
Been waitin' all year to
Light up the living room with you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh

We'll light up all the stockings
Hang some mistletoe
And stay up past our bedtimes
Pray for it to snow until we

Pick out a Christmas tree
Top shelf in aisle three
We'll tie it to the car
Hey, don't forget the star
And when we get back home
Plug it in and watch it glow
Been waitin' all year to
Light up the living room with you, ooh, ooh

You, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You might also like
So grab your kids and grab your coat
December's here with your 

Pick out a Christmas tree
Top shelf in aisle three
We'll tie it to the car
Hey, don't forget the star
And when we get back home
Plug it in and watch it glow
Been waitin' all year to
Light up the living room with you, ooh, ooh

You, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh (Yeah)
With you, ooh, ooh
You, ooh, ooh

Go pick out a Christmas tree with youEmbed
