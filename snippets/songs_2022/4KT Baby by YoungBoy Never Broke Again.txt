4KT Baby Lyrics
Xclusive made this
D-Roc
Uh-uh, ayy, this YoungBoy, nigga, what it is?
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
How you been feelin' out there, nigga, how you been doin'?
Mm-mm
You got yo steel? Mm, mm, oh-oh, no
Ayy, keep your head up, five

I don't know what the fuck would make them niggas try to play us
Or wanna hate us
That be that doped up shit that get your motherfuckin' head bust
Ridin' with my dude, he servin' food, and he just fed somethin'
Don't be confused, we grab them tools, and then go get somethin'
These pussy niggas scared of that dark side and that's where I roll at
And bitch, you know that
Keep a .22 tucked where my toe at
New school, I was tryna blow that
Go make a diss, yo' fuckin' ho ass
I can't wait to leave you dead with a fuckin' toe tag, bitch
Send a blitz, say they gon' get at me
Oh, I live on the wrong side of options
We be zippin' shit, know I be at war
That's 'cause we just sent like thirty through they car door
Got his mask on, fah, fah, fah
That's a 4KTrey baby
Walk up on 'em, lay shit down
That's them 4KTrey babies
Keep his flag, you know he bangin' green
4KTrey baby
Nawfside, concentration, 38, lil' slime crazy

Knock up on they door and talk Jamaican (What they said?)
They don't need no AC, but I think that's where he stay
Wait 'til he come home, give him a hot bed (Oh-oh)
We gon' be blammin' at his shit 'til we pop his head (Oh-oh)
Can't get my daddy off that cocaine
Can't get my nigga off them pills
Watch your back, 'cause this shit real
You can't stand up to that steel
Fuck these hoes, just get your dough
And keep a chopper where you live
We recruited some more soldiers
We won't die up in the field
Shoot the FN where that pussy nigga hat at, huh
I got big straps and big gats
And K2, that dope pack
Know I gotta pour the drank up, where that four at?
Got them young niggas roll with me, and everyone be on that
You might also like
Send a blitz, say they gon' get at me
Oh, I live on the wrong side of options
We be zippin' shit, know I be at war
That's 'cause we just sent like thirty through they car door
Got his mask on, fah, fah, fah
That's a 4KTrey baby
Walk up on 'em, lay shit down
That's them 4KTrey babies
Keep his flag, you know he bangin' green
4KTrey baby
Nawfside, concentration, 38, lil' slime crazyEmbed
