TranslationsEspanolStand On It Lyrics
Here we go again (Okay), big body Benz (Skrrt)
Cut off all my friends (Yeah), choppers for my enemies
Go and ask the streets about lil' Dominique, I been a beast
Really got my name from shootin' dice and sellin' niggas weed
557, .223s, 308s go through a car door
All the houses paid off, none of my hoes ain't got no car note
Sell a thousand, scream, "Free Ralo"
"Baby, you should stop it," I know
Everything's a profit, for sure
Pilot waitin' on us, let's go
Still be in the projects with ColdHearted and Q Ball
Wreck the 'Rari, buy a new one tomorrow, I'm too raw
I got foreigns all colors, like a pack of Starburst
When they ask me how it happened, I just tell 'em, "God works"
I'm tryna touch me a billi', still hustle like I'm on zero
Really done saved some niggas, that's why they call me the hero
Trappin' like this shit legal, I'm tryna uplift my people
I used to serve in a regal, I turned 'em into believers, yeah
I don't want your bitch, we can't swap out (Swap out)
They ain't on shit, tell 'em pop out (Pop out)
Mama, I got rich, look at your drop out (Drop out)
Guns up, it ain't nothin' to talk 'bout (Guns up)
Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say, I stood on it
Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everythin' I say, I stood on it

My life really a miracle, my bitches say I'm magical
I still fuck with lil' Critical, I ran through more then half of them
I put on for that avenue, I had to bust my ass for this (Word)
How a bitch who never even met me gon' try to tell my business?
How someone I only had sex with once gon' try to have a kid by me?
Once you cross that line, you dead, really, that's how it is with me
Brodie got rich off of Percs, he sell 'em twenty-five a piece
My lil' scammin'-ass bitch made quarter-million in a week
I ain't never thirsty, run into a ho and don't even speak
Got that blick' on me in public, hope they think it's only me
This shit different, they gotta go through my assistant, just to reach me
If nobody else gon' show 'em, I'll teach 'em (I'll teach 'em)

Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say, I stood on it
Outside in your city, lookin' good (Lookin' good)
It's a Draco' call it "Wish a nigga would" (It got wood on it)
And she think that she special, but I'm good on her (Good on her)
Handle business like I'm 'posed to, everything I say, I stood on itYou might also likeEmbed
