Umm Hmm Lyrics
(I got Hitman on the beat)
Uh
(Top, nigga)

Spin it, don't compare me to these broke-ass niggas
I aint never blow the whistle
Still see all my hoes official
Know I control it by buyin' all the stolen pistols, yeah
Can't tell me shit bout nothin' he said, he'll leave you dead, I know my nigga
We make hot, exotic rentals
When you see that window roll down
Don't fight back 'til that pole sound
This KelTec could knock hoes down
Bitch, get up out the way
Youngin sixteen, that's who we got with the Drac' and he ain't got no aim
Hold on, swing that frrt and blow out flames
We gon fight these cases with tactics, we dont give no names
4KTrey pallbearers, gravediggers, free Five, they got my slime in chains
Talk 'nough rah-rah, niggas, these niggas gon die they touch my fuckin' chain
Mhm
Kickin' shit, mhm
I hit that bitch, mhm
I kick my stick, mhm
I'm with that shit, that mhm
Got hella racks, mhm
Big-ass gats, mhm
Foreign whips, mhm
My bitch got a big old ass, mhm

Haha, laughin, but I'll shoot you in your shit, hold up, baow, baow
Take her, then I turn up your lil' bitch, hold up, wow, wow
I came with it, make her scrape this extra water on my wrist
I got the money, I'm juggin', I'm bouncin', I'm bootin', know nothin' 'bout no juggernaut
I got them youngins, them hitters, them killers, you know they gon' turn this shit up a notch
I got your ho and she bootin', I buy her a booty, she take 'em all to your spot
I put your bitch on a mission, she comin' back with it, I buy her Chanel, uh
Bitch, I crash out with that semi, they gon' call 12
Do the dash from them, skrrt
We don't stop for nothin', skrrt
Hold on, scrape the bowl, skrrt, skrrt
I'm a savage on these hoes
I don't wait for nothin', we'll drive off for to split them on the road

Kickin' shit, mhm
I hit that bitch, mhm
I kick my stick, mhm
I'm with that shit, that mhm
Got hella racks, mhm
Big-ass gats, mhm
Foreign whips, mhm
My bitch got a big old ass, mhm

We don't stop for nothin', skrrt
Hold on, scrape the bowl, skrrt, skrrt
I'm a savage on these hoes
