ay! Lyrics
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high

I wrote a letter to myself
In the form of a song I can play when the Sun shines
I know better than to trust
Anything that I say to myself when I'm this high

Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high
I just did an interview with my eyes closed (Motherfucker/Eyes closed)
I just sparked a blunt, it looked like pyro (Pyro)
Only comments I see are the bad ones (Yeah, yeah)
Only playlists I like are the sad ons
Yeah, I let the mdicine in, I know it don't help in the end
But I got depression again
I had a meeting at 7, I skipped it and slept in and woke up at 7 PM
I cut my hair off like Britney
Sprinkle dust like a pixie, wiped my nose like it's itchy
I'm tatted up, I don't give a fuck, yeah

Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high
When I'm this high, when I'm this high
I just looked in the mirror, who is this guy?
It's a full Moon, where the good shrooms?
I'm too fuckin' high, sound like a good school
Higher than Jehovah, highway to heaven you know
I'ma get pulled over, I might need a chauffeur
Lean in my soda so I'ma need a shoulder
Why you got yo' nose up? I smell like Guns N' Roses
You might also like
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high (Tunechi)
Ay, ay, ay, ay
I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high

I don't ever wanna fall when I'm this high4Embed
