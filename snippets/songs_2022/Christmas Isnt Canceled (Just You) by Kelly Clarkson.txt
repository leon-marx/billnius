TranslationsEnglishChristmas Isnt Canceled (Just You) Lyrics
Out in the cold
Standin' where the trees meet the road
This used to be our favorite spot in this town
Memories with you and me ruin it now (Woah-woah-woah)
That's where we met
Like a winter dream and I bet
I wasn't the first, and I won't be the last
Underneath that mistletoe, you've been so bad (Woah-woah-woah)

You ruined all my favorite things (All my favorite things)
But you won't take Christmas from me
I'll be hanging every light I find in this house
Playin' Christmas music so loud
This year Christmas won't be quite so blue
And I'm gonna shout too much and dance in the snow
Drink just enough to let us go
Christmas isn't canceled, just you

Lost at first
Thinkin' that I might (I might) be cursed
Winter Wonderlands weren't made for one
So we've all been told since we were young (Woah-woah-woah)

But I'm not feelin' incomplete (Feelin' incomplete)
Turns out I don't need a thing underneath my tree

I'll be hanging every light I find in this house
Playin' Christmas music so loud
This year Christmas won't be quite so blue
And I'm gonna shout too much and dance in the snow
Drink just enough to let us go
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
You might also like
(Christmas) Without you is still fun
(Christmas) And when the New Year comes
Don't you worry 'bout me, I'll be alright
Baby, by New Year's night, ooh

I'll be ringin' in the New Year with all my friends
Kissin' goodbye to what might've been
This year New Year's, I won't be your fool
And I bet you see me out wonderin' what's wrong
Watchin' me have fun with you gone
But New Year's isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Just you

Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled, just you
Christmas isn't canceled
Christmas isn't canceled2Embed
