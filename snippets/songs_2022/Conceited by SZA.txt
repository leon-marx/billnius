I don't like nobody, I don't feel guilty about it
I just got my body done, ain't got no guilt about it
I just heard your opinion, I could've did without it
All these bitches is minions, despicable like, oh (Oh)
Feelin' like Mike Lowrey, oh
'Bout to bump my salary up, oh (Oh)
Heard they counting me out
Love it when they counting me out, oh

I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool, oh
I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool
I got everything that I need and I want more
I can't take my foot off they neck, it's an encore
I got everything and I'm livin' all for rvenge
I been burnin' bridges, I'd do it ovr again
'Cause I'm bettin' on me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me
Oh, I'm bettin' on me, me, me
Me, me, me
Me, me, me, oh

Heard you fuckin' these lames and ain't lose no sleep about it
Ho be speakin' my name, I can't lose no sleep about it
Say that shit to my face, you know I'm gon' slide about it
Put that bitch in her place, she ain't make no peep about it
Oh (Oh), feelin' like a billion, oh
Feel like I might drill on your ho, oh (Oh)
I'm just livin' my goals (Goals)
Pressure makes diamonds, can't fold, oh

I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool, oh
I got no reason to depend on you
No reason to make friends, I'm cool
