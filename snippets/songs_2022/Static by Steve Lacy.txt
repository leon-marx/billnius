TranslationsEspanolStatic Lyrics
Baby, you got something in your nose
Sniffin' that K, did you feel the hole?
Hope you find peace for yourself
New boyfriend ain't gon' fill the void
Do you even really like this track?
Take away the drugs, would you feel the noise?
More and more you try to run away
You fucking yourself, do you feel the toy?
Uh, lookin' for a bitch 'cause I'm over boys
Would you be my girlfriend, baby?
Ooh, woah, woah, woah, woah
Something turned me off
Smoking made me*cough*
'Cause I, I'm longing for somethin' secure
If you had to stunt your shining for your lover, dump that fucker
Shoodoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoodoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoodoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Shoodoo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo, mmYou might also like8Embed
