Anti-Hero / Better / Meet Me At Our Spot (Mixed) Lyrics
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street, so we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is

Nothing feels better than this
It's me, hi, I'm the problm, it's me (I'm the problem, it's m)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
When I wake up
I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-heroYou might also likeEmbed
