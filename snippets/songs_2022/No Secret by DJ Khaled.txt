TranslationsEspanolPortuguesNO SECRET Lyrics
Yeah
They tryna sink they teeth in
Then act like we friends
Whole time it's pretend
So whole time on defense
Good evenin'
I walked out the precinct
No evidence to keep me
I'm top dog, no secret, oh
That's no secret at all
Can't nobody reach me, dawg
Can't nobody reach this far
I spill all my feelings, dawg
'Cause you'll never know this feeling, dawg
Ain't no secret at allYou might also like1Embed
