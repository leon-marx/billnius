War Lyrics
(Banger)
(DJ on the beat, so it's a banger)

Nigga, I'll be damned (Who?)
If a nigga think he finna take me out, this shit ain't sweet (Huh? Boom, boom)
Nigga, I ain't goin', I'm back, I'm blowin' (Yeah)
I'll be at his crib every day of the week (Shit)
'Member it was nights I couldn't even sleep (Huh? Huh?)
War outside, niggas couldn't even eat (Damn, damn)
I was sixteen with a Carbon 15 (Yeah)
Motherfuckers gotta die and it ain't gon' be me (Von, huh?)
Shootin' shit sunup to sundown (Uh)
He was just playin' tough, he gon' run now (Uh-huh)
All these bitch ass niggas tellin', really start to take the fun out (He get too wild)
I'm the type of nigga go to church with my gun out (In a shootout)
Gotta pray for my gun, he get too wild (H get too wild)
I'm the first name that thy say in the shootout (In the shootout)
God textin' me  like, "It's gettin' too crowded" (Damn, damn)
Police they catch me, I'm too silent (Damn)
My name speak volume, I'm too violent (Huh?)
Niggas actin' tough, run it up then, I'ma lay him down like two pallets (Boom, boom)
Dress a nigga up like a new stylist (Uh-huh)
Out for a year, nigga, when the trial is? (Uh-huh)
Would've bought that bitch a car but she had some mileage (Uh-huh)
If he say what he saw, we gon' cut his eyelid (Boom, boom, boom)
