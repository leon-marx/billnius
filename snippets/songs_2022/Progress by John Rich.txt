Progress LyricsThere's a hole in this country where its heart used to be
And Old Glory's divided, on fire in the street
They say Building Back Better will make America great
If that's a wave of the future, all I've got to say
Stick your progress where the sun don't shine
Keep your big mess away from me and mine
If you leave us alone, well we'd all be just fine
Stick your progress where the sun don't shine
They invite the whole world to come live in our land
And leave our countrymen dying in Afghanistan
They say let go of Jesus and let government save
You can have back your freedoms if you do what we say
Stick your progress where the sun don't shine
Keep your big mess away from me and mine
If you leave us alone, well we'd all be just fine
Stick your progress where the sun don't shine
They shut down our pipelines and they shut down our voices
They shut down our Main Streets and they shut down our choices
They bent us all over, but it's all over now
'Cause we've figured it out, we ain't backing down
Stick your progress where the sun don't shine
Keep your big mess away from me and mine
If you leave us alone, well we'd all be just fine
Stick your progress where the sun don't shine
Where the sun don't shine
Where the sun don't shine
Where the sun don't shineYou might also likeEmbed
