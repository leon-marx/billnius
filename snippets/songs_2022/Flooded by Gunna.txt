TranslationsEspanolflooded Lyrics
Ooh, Twix, stop playin'
Flooded
Flooded, flooded
Flooded

AP and Patek Philippe, flooded (Flooded)
And got the Richard Mille, flooded (Ice)
Cubans and bracelets and necklace (Ice), flooded
Stones in my teeth like they braces, flooded (Flooded)
Gold diamond chains, I'm the new Mr. T
All this ice on me, I could go and ski
Shorty on fleek with this Patek Philippe (Fleek)
Whole lot to see, clarity Vs
Cold like a polar bear, North Pole
Money stretch all the way from North Dakota (Dakota)
Know pretty bitches like Coca-Cola
Diamonds hit like they inmates in Angola (Hmm)
Look like a fight (Fight)
Block out your sight (Ice)
Whole lot of ice on (On)
These diamonds bite, we shining bright
Look like a light show (Show)
Hell of a price, expensive nights
She got a nice throat (Throat)
She got me right, I bought her ice

AP and Patek Philippe, flooded (Flooded)
And got the Richard Mille, flooded (Ice)
Cubans and bracelets and necklace (Ice), flooded
Stones in my teeth like they braces, flooded (Flooded)

I spent two-fifty on just one chain
None of this shit came from Johnny Dang
Eliantte got me goin' insane
Diamonds updated, they 'head of the game
I'm underrated, they AP from Vegas
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change
Pull up, Mercedes, my neck lookin' crazy
They hated, I waited, I knew shit would change
My life is wavy, I'm highly sedated
They thought I was crazy, I bought some more chains
Flood out the shady, I iced out the baby
And they goin' crazy protecting the name
Reach for these stones and get popped in your brain
No one's smoking stronger, they ain't stoppin' the train
Today is rose gold, I'm not rockin' the plain
I don't got it on, then I don't feel the same
