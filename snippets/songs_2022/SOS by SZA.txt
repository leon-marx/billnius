Last night, I cried

Give me a second, give me a minute
Nah, lil' bitch, can't let you finish
Yeah, that's right, I need commissions on mine
All that sauce you got from me
All that shit I gave for free
I want it back, want it back
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
Know you been more than lost
Without me, I'm so
Comin' back, I'm so greasy
Ex-nigga, he so needy
Punk ass tried to replace me, but the stakes is too high
They can't survive off mini-me
I'm talkin' pedigree
Ain't no writers, that's just me
Ain't no spiteful, I'm just tea
Can't hate a bitch for free
Talkin' I'm off the bench like Brady
I'm pressin' niggas like KD, it's up
Yeah, nigga, it's up to me
Remind you of Dlla Reese
So classic, that ass so fat, it look natural, it's not
I talk bullshit a lot
No more fuck-shit, I'm done
Damn right, I'm th one
Damn right, I'm the one
Comin' back, she so candid
Comin' back snatched like bandit
Comin' back, this ain't canned shit
I'm organic with my fresh squeezed
I'm dumpin' like press squeeze
I'm horny like, "Suck these"
So daring like, "Touch me"
And all the petty shit aside
All the funny shit aside
I just want what's mine
Mine, oh
I just want what's mine
This ain't no warnin' shot
Case all you hoes forgot
And I cried and cried
Said what's on my mind
Ooh, oh, I criedYou might also like5Embed
