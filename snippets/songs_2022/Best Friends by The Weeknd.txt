Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Hey
Yeah, yeah, yeah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, what we got
Baby, what we got is secure
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart
Things you want, I'm not lookin' for
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now
Oh, I don't want to be responsible
For your heart if we fall
'Cause I'll get clumsy and tear it apart
I love you so, but we can't get close
You're my best friend now
You're my best friend now
Oh, I love it when we climax (Climax)
And I would never burn you
I could never hurt you
If we do it like that
Don't try to take it further
Focus on the friendship
Get a little sidetracked
Catchin' little feelings
Thought we had arrangements
Thought you weren't like that
Yeah (Uh-uh), I thought you weren't like that

Oh, friends no more
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Friends no more
Ooh, friends no more, uh
Sex as friends no more
You don't wanna have sex as friends no more
Oh

Oh, what we got (Oh yeah)
Baby, what we got is secure
Been a part of toxic love
It tore us apart (Oh yeah)
Things you want, I'm not lookin' for (I'm not searchin')
You're my best friend now (Oh, baby)
You're my best friend now
Oh, I don't want to be responsible
For your heart if we fall (Oh no)
'Cause I'll get clumsy and tear it apart
I love you so (Oh yeah), but we can't get close
You're my best friend now (Best friend now)
You're my best friend now (Best friend now)
