We're goin' back in time
I'd like to see you try
Unpackin' thoughts through tunnels in your mind
I'll fix you mushroom tea
And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality

It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said
How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? (Ooh, ah)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me (Ooh, ah)
And make it last eternally?

I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And all the things you tolerated
Made you cold inside
But I can light you up again
Like embers of a fire

It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
It's quite unusual
Seekin' approval
Beggin' for it desperately
I said

How do I make you fall for me? (How do I make you fall?)
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? (Ooh, ah)
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me (Ooh, ah)
And make it last eternally?24Embed
