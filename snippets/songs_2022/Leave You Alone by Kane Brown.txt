Leave You Alone Lyrics
I know I don't say, "You're beautiful" enough
But that don't mean it ain't on my mind
And I know sometimes we have differences and fight
But I hate when I see you cry

And if you're ever worried I got one foot out that door
I can promise you right now, baby

My love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growin' old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
Baby, my love won't leave you alone
No-oh
Just like that red win stain on the carpet
Yeah, girl, I ain't goin' no whre (Hell nah)
And kinda like your favorite jeans with the hole in the pocket
Wherever you go, I'll be there

'Cause my love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growin' old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
'Cause my love won't leave you alone

Leave you alone (Won't leave you)
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (No, I won't)
Leave you alone (Won't leave you)
Leave you alone

And I don't know what life will look like fifty years down the road
But you can count on me bein' right here
You might also like
'Cause my love won't leave you alone
Just so you know
When I say forever, girl
I mean I'm never, ever gonna do you wrong
And I won't let you go
Talkin' us growing old
Here's dusk 'til dawn
We'll be goin' on and on
'Cause my love won't leave you alone

Leave you alone
Leave you alone (I won't leave you alone)
Leave you alone
Leave you alone (Oh, no, I won't)
Leave you alone
No, I won't leave you aloneEmbed
