Pray Lyrics
I thought I wanted love
'Til you showed me what it was
I've never been colder
All this weight that I shoulder
It's a blessin' and a curse
Fuck the better, it's only worse
Wouldn't wish this on no one
It's one hell of a low one

We goin' up, we goin' down
We could run it back, we could work it out, but
No
Late at night, goin' out my mind
Prayin' that the sun don't rise, like
No, mm
Wakin' up, but wishin' that you don't
(Ooh, ooh)
It's somethin' that I pray you'll never know
(Ooh, ooh)

Up at night, drinkin' liquor like it's water
Wakin' up, knowin' I'm somebody's daughter, but
I don't know a lot about my father
Maybe that's the reason I don't do shit like I oughta, no
I need some medicin, this shit that my head is in
Got me thinkin', questionin', layin' in this bd I'm in
Up at night, drinkin' liquor like it's water
Maybe that's the reason I don't do shit like I oughta, no

Wakin' up, but wishin' that you don't
(Ooh, ooh)
It's somethin' that I pray you'll never know
(Ooh, ooh)

You might love the highs, but you ain't seen the lows
You don't know the half of it and I pray you'll never know
Woah
You might also like
Wakin' up, but wishin' that you don't (Wishin' that you don't)
(Ooh, ooh)
It's somethin' that I pray you'll never know
(Ooh, ooh)

You'll never know, you'll never know
You'll never know5Embed
