TranslationsDeutschmaybe Lyrics
That's hard
Two, three, five

Maybe if I had something to say
Butterfly effect from the last three days now
Maybe if I had something to save
I used to have a soul until I threw it away
There's shadows on the wall, wish I would've ran (Yeah)
Gotta get away, I hope you understand
I try to hide my face like a wanted man (Yeah)
Maybe I'll be gone before you count to ten
I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking th last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm rady to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last

Maybe if we went another way (Another way)
I wouldn't be regretting the decisions that I made
I don't want to spend another day (Another day)
Looking for somebody that I know I can't replace
My tears fall, you don't miss me
Put me out my misery
Think my heart is history
I think I'm broke and nothing can fix me

I made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last
You might also like
Yeah (Maybe)
We were built to fall apart
But I can't feel you now
And it's too late now, there's no point screaming
Dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
No one's here, so now you're on your own

Made up my mind this evening
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
Drink while my conscience eats me
I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
I'm ready to let you go
This time is the last, this time is the last18Embed
