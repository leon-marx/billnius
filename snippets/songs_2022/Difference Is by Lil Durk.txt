TranslationsEspanolDifference Is Lyrics
(TouchofTrent be wildin' with it)

Pussy drippin' on the dick, bitch tryna get nasty
When you spendin' six figures in the store, they gotta bag it
You can't blame me, that shit you doin', it got me braggin'
When I touch your hair when you get it done, you turnin' ratchet, hmm

Mmm, and the difference is
My bitch bad and she killin' them
Mmm, and the difference is
We don't put the world in our business still
And they keep askin'
Sexy lil' bitch, put on her mink lashes
I'm talkin' Gucci glasses or Chanel team jacket
She gon' get it without asking, she on queen status
You ridin' solo in that forign, no need to pass the blunt
I know them niggas feelin' stupid, whoevr passed you up
I put my fingers in her private in the restaurant
And she get mad when I'm off them drugs 'cause I don't cum fast enough
I'm in her tummy, steady cummin', I give her another liter
She steady runnin', pussy yummy, cut on that Justin Bieber
When I was nothin', gave her a hunnid, I did a couple features
Don't let her see the other side, I be with them demons

Mmm, and the difference is
My bitch bad and she killin' them
Mmm, and the difference is
We don't put the world in our business still

I'ma ride for my baby
There ain't nothin' wouldn't do for you

You know I'll get mine, boy, if I'm comfortable
And you know how I get, boy, I'm possessive
I don't want no other bitch to touch up on my best friend
You show me how it feels when they deserve you and cherish these moments
That's what he wanted
'Cause the difference is, you ain't no fuck nigga and I'm feelin' it
