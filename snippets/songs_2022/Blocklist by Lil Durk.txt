DJ Bandz, oh, man

Before you block me I'm tryna text you, "I'm sorry that I hurt you"
I'm a street nigga with a name but certain shit just ain't worth it
And I'm sorry what I did to you, I know you didn't deserve it (Deserve it)
I told you 'bout all the hoes I fucked, you got a little discouraged (Little discouraged)
Told your friends about our problems, shit made me nervous
Please don't put me on that block list 'cause I don't deserve it
I gotta answer the private call 'cause you might call restricted
And I say you my prize possesion 'cause I had to earn you (Had to earn you)
I bring yo' laughs out
I snd you money whenevr you need, I send you Cash App
I call yo' phone, I can't get through, I make a text out
Pull up to your OG crib, that's the next step (Oh)
The worst feeling to be on that block list (Block list)
I thought it was fun and games to be toxic
Came in the crib, my clothes in boxes (In boxes)
I grab her hand like, "Could you stop it?" (No)
Don't feel good to be on that block list (Block list)
Why you put me on that block list? (Block list)
I can't get through, I'm on that block list (Block list)
I'm tryna talk to you, I'm on that block list (Block list)

I don't even answer for all of my guys
They talkin' 'bout bitches all on my line
I talk about street shit all the time
I don't talk about hoes all on my live
One time she had made me cry
And I'm like, "Some shit had got in my eye"
I ain't gon lie, I love the fact that she don't be kickin' it 'round my guys
Loyal, she gon' tell me like, "One of them niggas tried"
"Love you", if I tell you that, I'ma tell you a hundred times
Gullible, told me if I ever cheat, "Don't be with strays"
Comfortable, she want hundred, I put a hundred in her bag
Perfect timing, I had to give her diamonds
I be vibing, this loyal shit is timeless
She like curry chicken bird, I like salmon
Every time I'm freakin' her, I give her allowance

Don't feel good to be on that block list (Block list)
Why you put me on that block list? (Block list)
I can't get through, I'm on that block list (Block list)
I'm tryna talk to you, I'm on that block list (Block list)You might also like1Embed
