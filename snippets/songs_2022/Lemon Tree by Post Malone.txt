TranslationsTurkceEspanolLemon Tree Lyrics
Couldn't fall asleep all night
I tried with all my might
I thought I knew what you want
It isn't all that nice
But I guess it will suffice
It's hard to know what you want

Could you be?
A little less sour, we're rottin' by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
In every film I watch, I'm on the side of the bad guy
So turn around and show me that I'm better
Some people got an apple, some people got a tangerine
Look around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told
I guess I'm just shit outta luck, growing a lemon tree
I'm gonna burn it down, and grow me somethin' bettr
Hey-ah, hey-ah

Blood on my hands, I'm on the fnce, I double down
A swing and a miss, a kick in the ribs, in trouble now
Came from the dirt, back in the ground, when I die
But I'ma survive, I got my ways
Oh, oh

Could you be?
A little less sour, we're rottin' by the hour
And my heart's rotten too
In every film I watch, I'm on the side of the bad guy
So turn around and show me that I'm better

Some people got an apple, some people got a tangerine
(Some people got a tangerine, na, na, na)
Look around and all I see is people happy with what they're given
Life is pretty sweet, I'm told (I'm told)
I guess I'm shit outta luck, growin' a lemon tree
(Growin' a lemon tree)
I'm gonna burn it down and grow me somethin' better
Hey-ah, hey-ah

(And grow me somethin' better)
(And grow me somethin' better)
(And grow me somethin' better)15Embed
