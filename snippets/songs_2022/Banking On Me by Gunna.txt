TranslationsPortuguesBanking On Me Lyrics
Metro Boomin want some more, nigga

She bankin' on me, I'm the bank (Bank)
I smack her, she love to get spanked (Get spanked)
I tackle her, bitch love to wrestle (To wrestle)
Young bachelor, we love to play (Play)
Sun come out when I move the drapes (Drapes)
Know my mood when I grab your waist (Waist)
Know you fuckin' a man that's made (Made man, hey)
Keep it lowkey, she ain't after fame
No she ain't after fame (Amen)
You ain't like that old ho' I usd to be fuckin'
You and her nothin' the sam (Nothin' the same)
Don't care 'bout no cuffin', you wanna keep bussin'
Then girl, let me know when you came (You came)
I love you in so many ways (Ways)
Don't know why you never complain ('Plain)
With you, I can never be shamed (Uh)
Mm, and I usually never say, "Never"
Oh shit, look at me today
Love your vibe, I don't need no sage (Sage, hey)
Clear coat and your car look glazed (Glazed)
Good sex, that ain't all we made
I don't wanna get tired of you (Huh)
I'm in a bossy mood, we at the top and we got us a ocean view (Got us a ocean view)
I know I got it, I'm all in her body
And nobody got a clue (Nobody got a clue)
We in a coupe pullin' up, board a private, a G5 for only two (G5 for only two)
I really like it, I wan' stay excited, don't wanna get tired of you
Don't wanna get tired of you, don't wanna get tired of you
Don't wanna get tired of you, don't wanna get tired of you
Don't wanna get tired of you, don't wanna get tired of you

You wake up and you wanna go shoppin' (Yeah)
Pick out a car, you got too many options
Bubblegum baby, yeah, you got it poppin' (Pop)
Love what you do for the papi (Yeah)
Pelion, I'm all in her, mouthful, you suck it sloppy (Ooh)
You like the queen of the moppin'
Soon as I cum, she keep suckin', I don't want her to stop it (Don't want her to stop it)
Dick in, I'm breakin' her back and I'm strokin'
I see why they cause a commotion (Yeah)
Hittin' it, lookin' at views of the ocean
Her pussy wet as an ocean (Wet as an ocean)
Handle that business, I'm boss by the way I'm approachin' (Boss)
Young Gunna Wunna, he chosen
East to the West, we just really been coastin'
Me and lil' baby in motion

We in a coupe pullin' up, board a private, a G5 for only two (G5 for only two)
I really like it, I wan' stay excited, don't wanna get tired of you
Don't wanna get tired of you, don't wanna get tired of you
Don't wanna get tired of you, don't wanna get tired of you
Don't wanna get tired of you, don't wanna get tired of you6Embed
