Truth About You Lyrics
Yeah, this town's been telling me
I've done some things I never did
Yeah, the grapevine starts with a glass of wine
And you taking a sip
Every word that you're saying's
Another stab to my reputation
And I can't take it anymore
But you've opened that door

Yeah, there's two sides to every breakup
One's a lie and one's the truth
One of 'em went down and one was made up
But in the end we both lose
Why can't we meet in the middle
Call it even, call a truce
If you quit telling lies about me
I won't tell the truth about you
Like how you picked a fight
Every time you saw me get a text
To make yourself feel better
That you still talk to your ex
Yeah, you told your friends, you told your mama
That I'm the root of all the drama
But we both know why this ended
Girl, I caught you red-handed

Yeah, there's two sides to every breakup
One's a lie and one's the truth
One of 'em went down and one was made up
But in the end, we both lose
Why can't we meet in the middle
Call it even, call a truce
If you quit telling lies about me
Well, I won't tell the truth about you

Yeah, I truly wish the best for you
So don't ruin the next for me
'Cause you really don't want me to tell the truth
For everyone to see, yeah
You might also like
That there's two sides to every breakup
One's a lie and one's the truth
One of 'em went down and one was made up
In the end, we both lose
Why can't we meet in the middle
Call it even, call a truce
Yeah, if you quit telling lies about me
Well, I won't tell the truth about you
(Won't tell the, won't tell the, won't tell the truth about you)
Tell the truth about
(Won't tell the, won't tell the, won't tell the truth about you)
(Won't tell the, won't tell the, won't tell the truth about you)
I don't wanna tell the truth
(Won't tell the, won't tell the, won't tell the truth about you)Embed
