(Metro)
Like I know you want
She sit in here for hours, even 'til Im done
It was all cool when it was just for fun
(If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon shoot you)

Too much here on your mental
Gotta switch up the tempo
Daddy callin' in ten fo'
Show us here what that Benz for
I'm locked into your info
I'm 'bout to jump out the window
I seen too many worlds, and I
Want you to be my girl, and I
Know I gotta keep them drugs around me
I gotta keep a couple plugs around me
I, I seen way too many worlds, and I, and I
Want you to be my girl, and I
Know I keep a couple drugs around me
I gotta keep a couple plugs around me

Now you wanna talk when the money come in
Niggas went bad, they goin' out sad, they never gon' win
I been goin like ten for tn
Get it on movie, get it on film
Gt it on movie, get it on film
Pour my cup way above the brim
I went and got the cut with the all-white trim
Finna go and dunk way above the rim
Gutter nights, it was hard to flip
Niggas was lit when the hard hit
I aint think twice whenever I'd get it
I was goin Shiest' with the all-black fitted

I was goin' Shiesty in all-black
I was on ten when you called back
Had to think twice and you fall back
I hit a mean lick and it was all racks
I was goin' Shiesty in all-black
I was on ten when you called back
Had to think twice and you fall back
I hit a mean lick and it was all racks
You might also like
I seen too many worlds, and I
Want you to be my girl, and I
Know I gotta keep them drugs around me
I gotta keep a couple plugs around me
I, I seen way too many worlds, and I, and I
Want you to be my girl, and I
Know I keep a couple drugs around me
I gotta keep a couple plugs around me

Heroes are inspired
Emerging only when needed
Revealing themselves to the world in a moment marked by the realization of their ultimate destiny
With backs against the wall, they ascend the winding path of their own fate
Barely knowing the ledge, despite coping with living their whole life as two halves8Embed
