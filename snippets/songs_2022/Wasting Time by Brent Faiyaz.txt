TranslationsPortuguesWASTING TIME Lyrics
You can't even sit in peace
'Cause all of these niggas be on you
I'm just sayin' I can be (Yeah)
The one that you call and you talk to, girl

I'll share my world with you
If you're gonna waste your time (Yeah)
Then waste your time with me
I mean, honestly
Open your eyes and see
Who's givin' you what you need?
If you're gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space
More than you need
It's no pressure, girl
If you got time to waste (Waste)
Waste it with me

And I be worried 'bout them (Oh)
Girl, you want it, I see you (Oh)
And I am who I am (Oh)
And I be where I be (Where I be)
If you ever hit me on the late night (Yeah)
I'll give you a clear mind
Might give you some insight

I'll share my world with you
If you're gonna waste your time (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Then waste your time with me
I mean, honestly
Open your eyes and see
Who's givin' you what you need?
You might also like
If you're gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space
More than you need
It's no pressure, girl
If you got time to waste (Waste)
Waste it with me

Don't close your eyes to get away (Ooh)
Just bang my line and I'll arrange it (Ooh)
Beautiful, girl, you're stainless
You be fine, I'll be painless, yeah
All them drinkin' the champagne
Oh, you wanted the same thing

Yeah
The Ten Thousand Building, get your ass an apartment
Put you inside a G-Class, that's just a starter kit
Plenty things count in life, but none of them is a thought of it
New piece around my neck, it's chest games
'Cause shorty stay with calculatin' moves, like Beth Harmon
Swear I'm more "Purple Rain" Prince than Prince Charmin'
Disappointment, I stay expectin' it, the pessimist gold medalist
Flushed the Magnums just so they not collectin' my specimens, damn (Damn)
The way she with papi, man, you would think she's a veteran on remembrance
Cleanin' lady sweep the room daily for all the evidence
Of everything I ever did (I ever did)
Do they have a pool there? Do they have a gym there?
You used to do skincare, but now you do swimwear
Your ex-roommate got a condo that's downtown
But she got no furniture in the crib, I've been there (Been there)
Checkmate, even though you hate that I even check her
I'll still get an E for effort
Only time I play the back and forth is Aaliyah record
If I let you talk first, then nobody is speakin' second
Fluent in passive aggression, that's why you actin' dismissive
Hearin' me out for once would require you actually listen, damn (Damn)
The boy is back, I never turned my back
I just lapped 'em, so now all that they see is my back
Say that then, Maybach Benz with me in the back
When I was in Acura, still couldn't clean up my act
Whenever I tell the truth, you feel like you bein' attacked
But that come with bein' attached, so how 'bout we leave it at that? (Leave it at that)
If you're gonna waste your time
Then waste your time with me
You can have all the space
More than you need
It's no pressure, girl
If you got time to waste (Waste)
Waste it with me7Embed
