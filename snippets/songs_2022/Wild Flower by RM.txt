TranslationsRomanizationEnglishEspanolPortugues (Wild Flower) Lyrics

Flower field, that's where I'm at
Open land, that's where I'm at
No name, that's what I have
No shame, I'm on my grave
     
    
   
   
  
  
   
   
      
 
    
      
   
  
    
Oh, every day and every night
Persistin' pain and criminal mind
     
   
I do wish me a lovely night
   life
    
     
Where you go, where's your soul
Yo, where's your dream?

  
Light a flower, flowerwork
Flower, flowerwork
  
Light a flower, flowerwork
Flower, flowerwork
