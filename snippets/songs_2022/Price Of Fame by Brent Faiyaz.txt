Mmm
Mmm-mmm, mmm, mmm-mmm
Ayy, yeah-ayy
Look, look

They just wanna take me off of here
They just wanna knock me off my square, look at that
I can't fake a smile, it's hard to wear
And I can't show no love, that shit too rare
Is it 'cause my whip so fast you don't see no flaws? (Whew, whew, whew)
Is it 'cause my bitch so bad she blew you off? Look at that
All of the things they want
And don't know why they want it (I know, look)
They don't wanna give you time to heal
They just wanna bleed you dry, for real
And if you're comfortable (Yeah), don't let no one know
They'll fuck it up (I know), that's right (Ayy, yeah-ayy), look
(The fame) I swear it isn't everything
(Glitz and glam) It isn't everything
(People screaming your name) I swear it isn't everything
(The demands) It isn't everything

They just wanna take me off of here
They just wanna knock me off my square, look at that
I can't fake a smile, it's hard to wear
And I can't show no love, that shit too rare
Is it 'cause my whip so fast you don't see no flaws? (Whew, whew, whew)
Is it 'cause my bitch so bad she blew you off? Look at that
All of the things they want
And don't know why they want it (I know, look)
They don't wanna give you time to heal
They just wanna bleed you dry, for real
And if you're comfortable (Yeah) don't let no one know
They'll fuck it up (I know), that's right (Ayy, yeah-ayy), look

(The fame) I swear it isn't everything (Everything)
(Glitz and glam) It isn't everything
(People screaming your name) I swear it isn't everything (Everything)
(The demands) It isn't everything

If you feel what I feel
You know that I'm real
If you feel what I feel
You know that I'm real

You don't need someone to make you feel better
Than you've ever felt (Ooh, ooh)
You know what you need is someone who will be there
When you don't feel yourself (Ooh, ooh)

Oh, I ain't sellin' dreams to you, baby
That ain't my style
I never said that I was the best in the world (Nobody perfect)
But I'm the best for you, girl (And so it's worth it), just stay for a while
Or until you feel like leaving
It's on you, all of it (Oh, oh-oh)

If you feel what I feel
You know that I'm real (I'm real, mmm-mmm)
If you feel what I feel
You know that I'm real (Oh, baby)
Hardest to try
You still get mad at this guy
'Cause you been fighting all your life, fighting all your life (Ooh, ooh)
(I've been praying for ya)
Even though sometimes it's like I don't know ya
But some time is all we have (The present is a blessing)
(If you didn't know, stop fucking 'round)

Oh, I ain't sellin' dreams to you, baby
That ain't my style
I never said that I was the best in the world
But I'm the best for you, girl, just stay for a while (Can you stay for a while)
A while
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)

If you feel what I feel
You know that I'm real (I'm real, ooh, woah-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, ooh, woah, oh-oh)
If you feel what I feel
You know that I'm real13Embed
