Restoration Lyrics
I run the race, when I started from the gate
Pimp shot his ho in the ass so she shot him in the face
Wish I was there, we could have dropped him in the lake
From the evils that men do, I've lost some of my faith
Never found it
Some hear the facts and get astounded
When you gotta go through it
And there ain't no way around it
I felt the pain, so I figure better drown it
Shorty cooking in a thong, booty very rounded
It's the type of sight that make you shed a tear for a blind man
Started chasing money very second the time ran
Sound like a fine plan, fly through the highland
Slap the pan optics on the boat, hit the side scan
Couldn't find the competition, they don't fuckin' exist
Hunger pains have my stomach in twist
Remember days, there was only moldy buns in the fridge
If I die before I'm rich, throw me under the bridge
Find me cheffing in the place
Where the oxygen ain't safe
Every time that I cook up
I put caution on the tape
Make a half a million
Lock a hundred in the safe
In the race
I salute the ones that's running up the pace

They heard Sonzarelli was gone but now he back in town
They was talking like I wouldn't come back around
Na, who dat? I'm where the hot pursuit at
Brought some chicken to my girl with the ass
And told her stew that
Say I'm rude, follow the rules, I couldn't do that
Dreams of the Q7, got em with the roof rack
12, tryin to figure where the crew at
Young gunners missed they fucking targets
Like there was no one to shoot at
Nowadays, the ends get crazy, a lot of wild shit
A lot of violence, lots of hand to hand vile shit
Hookers fucking on the same couch that they child sits
We ain't pulling over the whip, we let the tires skid
I'm like a young Johnny Depp with the classics
Drive to Vegas on a head full of acid
I only ever have 1 question and I ask it
All that really matters is the bread in the basket
You might also like
Find me cheffing in the place
Where the oxygen ain't safe
Every time that I cook up
I put caution on the tape
Make a half a million
Lock a hundred in the safe
In the race
I salute the ones that's running up the pace1Embed
