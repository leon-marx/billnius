Put It On Me Lyrics
Hmm-mm (Leor, light it up)
Huh, huh, huh, hmm-mm
Man, this that Raq talk, look, look

She wan' put that pussy on me, put it on me
Come and pull up on me, make sure that they don't see
We gon' fuck from night to all the way to the morning
I had to tell that bitch like, "She said them niggas claim they gon' dome me"
Don't move boy, you got me fucked up, we gon' split ya head, yeah
Did my first drill with B, pulled down the street, tryna paint some shit red
You talk that shit then stand on that, better be 'bout what you said
Won and lost fights, inside the feds, these pussy niggas be scared
Got this lil' ho, wan' come put it on me, no on know or gon' see
She know how I'm comin', she don't get no mony
Like I stab it back-to-back, I got her wet like a fountain
I picked that ass up, she said, "Don't down me"
He pussy, nigga, yeah-yeah
I don't like that nigga, yeah-yeah
One of them ho ass boys try me, I bet I'll paint the fuckin' city red (Red-red)
Fuck yo' mama, call the feds
Bet you see just how I play it
We get active, leave out bust tags
Gotta scuffle nigga down we tag
Pockets got money, plus I got it on me
This bitch need some visine, 'cause she actin' like she don't see
Fireworks, need a A to graduate, I got a K with me
You don't understand, need a A or address, that K gon' dirty work 'em from the street
Bitch, through my whole life I had to beef
Buy dirty guns 'cause it's a war
Who say that they gon' pop YB? Yeah
We wet your feet, we play for keeps
Inside that water, ain't no sleep, so bitch, you best to have ya heat
Ain't never played 'round with my nose, point to above, gettin' full of Joe's
I know you know this shit get deep
Mama been out here on my own, my girl try hard to hold me down
But this other ho keep blowin' my phone up, yeah
I done shed tears inside that cell, I done touched down, time to cause hell
Layin' who that is, them looks prevail
Yeah, told her, "Buy condoms out the shell"
She text the phone, she said she headed over here
You might also like
She wan' put that pussy on me, put it on me
Come and pull up on me, make sure that they don't see
We gon' fuck from night to all the way to the morning
I had to tell that bitch like, "She said them niggas claim they gon' dome me"

Lil' mama wanna put it on me
I'm rollin' bitch, I make her leave
Next time that she wanna pull up, I keep making her beggin' me, "Please"
Let off shots, opp get struck from the truck
Bust 'em, zip 'em, that's keepin' the peace
Bitch, please don't get to postin' shit that them niggas get the drop on me

She wan' put that pussy on me, put it on me
Come and pull up on me, make sure that they don't see
We gon' fuck from night to all the way to the morning
I had to tell that bitch like, "She said them niggas claim they gon' dome me"1Embed
