Purge Me Lyrics
(Pipe that shit up, TnT)

Mmm, headache from me hurtin'
This Percocet ain't workin'
Hope that you won't do me dirty, ah
I drink lean out the bottle
Soul flying rider, from the bottom, I'ma shine up
I won't hurt you if you don't hurt me
I ain't seen you yet, I'm working
I got choppas on the seat, I ain't worried
Got my daughter upstairs, please don't try to purge me
Yeah, baby, I'm a demon, I be high as I could be, yeah
Man, I miss my niggas, I'm by myself, I'm drinkin' lean
Can't run out, I need more potion
No, I ain't the only one that's hurtin'
I can't say some things right now, but you know one thing for certain
I fuck with you, that's why I pulled up with you, you know
You don't notice everything that you do
She want that coup I bought it, I'm in her head
You do what you do, I'm 'bout it
Now, you go ahead
I'm a young nigga, I got big Bnjis
Uh, came up, I ain't goin' broke no more
Gotta make sure they know, oh-oh
Got four-eight bitches, stay out my business
I ain't goin' out sad behind no ho
I say, "Oh no," oh-oh
From the top to the bottom
Know you better watch out, I'm a goblin
Grave digger, I want all the problems
Pallbearer, we handle they body
Get it poppin', she know how I'm rockin'
She don't know, but she know all about it
Stick beside me, I'm floodin' her body
Everything that I buy is exotic (Woah-woah)
How do you feel when you with me?
Mmm, up the pole, this drip from overseas
Lay you down and strip you out your jeans, ahh
I won't hurt you, just don't plan on hurtin' me, ah
You might also like
Mmm, headache from me hurtin'
This Percocet ain't workin'
Hope that you won't do me dirty, ah
I drink lean out the bottle
Soul flying rider, from the bottom, I'ma shine up
I won't hurt you if you don't hurt me
I ain't seen you yet, I'm working
I got choppas on the seat, I ain't worried
Got my daughter upstairs, please don't try to purge me1Embed
