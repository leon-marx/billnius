TranslationsDJ Khaled - PARTY ft. Quavo & Takeoff (Traduccion al Espanol)PARTY Lyrics
(Party all the time, party all the time, party all the time)
We the Best Music (My girl wants to party all the time, party all the time)
(Another one)
(DJ Khaled)

I like the ratchetest women (Go)
Woo, woo, G6, let's get it (Woo)
Rich niggas comin down to the city (On God)
Your bitch outside gettin' litty
Showin' me the titties (Woo), actin like a menace (Su')
Standin' on the couch (What?), standin' on business (Go)
Drink's in your mouth (Drank), swallow, don't spit it (Swallow)
Party all the time (Woo), feelin' like Diddy (Diddy)
Chandelier wrist (Ice), feelin' like billi (Billi)
God did, God did, I'm a witness (Woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to bitches (Woo)
Know the gang in the VIP, by the pendant (Su)
Still in the meeting, be back in a minute (Brr, brr)
The phone talkin' chicken (Hey)
We the best, we too blessed, we keep winnin' (We the best)
The party won't stop, it wont finish, let's get it
Let's get it (Get it), we did it (Did it)
I'm committed (Committed), we all in it (In it)
In the city (City), we gettin' litty (Lit)
Get out your feelings and go get some Benjis

God did, God did, I'm a witness (Woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to bitches (Woo)
Know the gang in the VIP, by the pendant (Su')
Still in the meeting, be back in a minute

I tell her activate, throw it back, it got an aftertaste
Patty cake, caught me six figures, a Patek face (Patek)
Went to school and hard knockin', I graduated
I can't fuck with that bitch, she be aggravated
If I can't get that bag, I'm agitated (Bag)
She poppin' that ass, but she graduated (Pop it)
On shrooms at the party, it's animated (Animated)
They keep tellin' me it's my time
To Tony Hawk grind, like, fuck it, I gotta take it (Fuck it)
Angels watch over me
Lookin' at demons and shit, can't run, you gotta face it (Face it)
When they give up on you, they don't even fuck with you (Fuck 'em)
Take it back to the basis (Bitch)
I'm a Don Dada, lacin' my Pradas
Poppin' my collar, Three 6 Mafia (Get it)
You might also like
We did it (Did it)
I'm committed (Committed), we all in it (In it)
In the city (City), we gettin' litty (Lit)
Get out your feelings and go get some Benjis

God did, God did, I'm a witness (Woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to bitches (Woo)
Know the gang in the VIP, by the pendant (Su')
Still in the meeting, be back in a minute

Capiche, we eatin on tilapia
It's a mob party, mob party, sound like a lion when the engine started
Came from that bando, we sell out the Garden (Bando)
You said what? Beg your pardon (What?)
The trench coat keep a carbon (Brr)
I pop out the coupe with a ratchet bitch (Ratchet)
But I got a contact on barbies (Barbie)
Ducati, Kawasaki, Harleys (Skrrt)
Designer garments for the goddess (Yes)
I was humble, but fuck bein' modest
This what you do when you got it (Pop it)
I lost my grandma, we lost Lil Keed
Had a nigga feelin' like Gotit (Mama)
Party all the time, put it on the line
If she not a dime, then she ain't mine (Get it)
We did it (Did it)
I'm committed (Committed), we all in it (In it)
In the city (City), we gettin' litty (Lit)
Get out your feelings and go get some Benjis

God did, God did, I'm a witness (Woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to bitches (Woo)
Know the gang in the VIP, by the pendant (Su')
Still in the meeting, be back in a minute

Put that shit on, I ain't tryin', ballin' on NBA combine (Ball)
Steppin' on niggas, it's crunch time (Steppin')
Eat up that pussy, it's lunch time (Eat it)
Give me that pussy like Webbie (Give me that)
She got that splash, that wetty (Splash)
We party all night and she never forget it (Never forget it)
Takeoff (Get it)

We did it (Did it)
I'm committed (Committed), we all in it (In it)
In the city (City), we gettin' litty (Lit)
Get out your feelings and go get some Benjis

God did, God did, I'm a witness (Woo)
I just sent fifty bottles to bitches (Woo)
Know the gang in the VIP, by the penant (Su')
Still in the meeting, be back in a minute

Ayy (Ayy)
