TranslationsProud Lyrics
(Ayo, BandPlay)
Ayy, yeah

I lost my dog, I lost my mind, no lie, I'm really lost inside
I can get it back in blood, but still, I can't get back the time
Fuck that humble shit, let's go, you know I'm spazzin' out 'bout mine
I got Dolph lookin' down on me, I know that nigga proud

Ayy, don't worry 'bout Glizock, nigga, I'ma hold it down (Yeah)
I went and got some blue diamonds to let 'em know you still around (Yeah)
And ain't shit change, I'm still doin' my thing and makin' niggas frown
Yeah, that money still flowin' in on this Paper Route (Phew, phew, phew, phew)
I still don't trust these bitches either, I just slut 'em out
Lately, I been talkin' to the reaper, I can't shut him out
I been prayin' on my knees but don't feel like it's working out (Yeah)
Yeah, It's P.R.E. for life, nigga, even after I die
Think I was born with that fire, I prolly go out wit' my nine (Yeah)
I'm 'bout that shit for real and you can see it in my eyes (Yeah)
I been tryna drink the pain away, sippin' line after line (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm fucked up, no cap, just the other day, caught myself cryin'
Then I wiped my face, shook that shit off and got back on my grind (Yeah)
And if ain't about no money then I'm deaf, the same time blind
I got dark clouds all over me but somehow, I still shine
Yeah, I bring bags home like groceries, we started flippin' dimes
Now I'm doin' shows all overseas, bitch, look at me now
I'm my brother's keeper, fuck you mean? This shit deeper than rap
And if I ever get the chance bet I won't miss a hundred rounds (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
If I ever get the chance, bet I won't miss a hundred rounds (Fah, fah, fah, fah, fah, fah)
I lost my dog, I lost my mind, no lie, I'm really lost inside
I can get it back in blood, but still, I can't get back the time
Fuck that humble shit, let's go, you know I'm spazzin' out 'bout mine
I got Dolph lookin' down on me, I know that nigga smilin'

And my auntie lookin' down on me, your baby still wylin' (Yeah)
I been reminiscin', sippin' triss, and twistin' up these flowers
Took a look up in the mirror and told that boy the world is ours (Ayy, yeah)
Fuck this money, fuck this fame, yeah, I got respect, I got power (Yeah)
They been tellin' me to sit down 'cause they know a nigga slidin' (Yeah)
Bitch, I carry my own weight, nigga, ain't nothin' bout me slimy (Bitch)
I come from a city niggas get rich or die tryin'
Plenty lil' niggas wit' big guns screamin' out, "Who wanna die?"
I never been a fuck nigga, that never been my kind
I just had a talk with daddyo, he told me don't waste no time
So I'ma put this shit up in they face and keep your name alive (Yeah)
So I'ma put this shit up in they face and keep your name alive (Flippa)

Yeah, nigga, fuck everybody and fuck everything nigga
Get money nigga, run that shit up nigga
Run that shit all the way up nigga
'Til you can't run it no more the fuckin' more nigga
All the way up nigga
(Ayy, yeah) Up, up nigga
(I lost my dog, I lost my mind, no lie, I'm really lost inside)
(I can get it back in blood, but still, I can't get back the time)
(Fuck that humble shit, let's go, you know I'm spazzin' out 'bout mine)
