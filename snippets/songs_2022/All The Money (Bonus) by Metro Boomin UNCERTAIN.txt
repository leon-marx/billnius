Move Over Lyrics
Horse meat burger, shake and fries
Let 'em eat cake, now where's the surprise
Payday loans, it's almost funny
Too much month at the end of the money
All this stress and all this worry
All this fret and all this hurry
Cut to the bone until you can't keep up
Someone comes and tells you it's a storm in a teacup

Try to take a minute to pause for thought
We know who's to blame, they all got caught
Tried to lie, tried to disown us
Lost all the money, walked away with a bonus
Snouts in trough, hands in till
Call out the cops, call the old bill
Then blame the weakest, the poor and the frail
So no-one ends up in the slammer, sent to jail
I hope you'll agree that you shouldn't have to be told twice
We asked you once and we asked real nice
Think it's time you move over (Time to move over)
I can see you're all for one but you've never been one for all
I suppose you think that's pretty cool
Well now it's time to move over (Time to move over)
Time to move over

Well, less your heart and bless your soul
You thought we'd be saved by rock 'n' roll
Where are your heroes when we need them now
Keeping out of sight, silent, keeping all their heads down
All the old hippies, all the old punks
All the old potheads, all the old drunks
All the old rebels have all settled down
Keeping all the dollars, hoarding all the pounds

Well I hope you'll agree that you shouldn't have to be told twice
We asked you once and we asked real nice
Think it's time you moved over (Time to move over)
I can see you're all for one but you've never been one for all
I suppose you think that's pretty cool
Well now it's time to move over (Time to move over)
You might also likeWell I hope you'll agree that you shouldn't have to be told twice
We asked you once and we asked real nice
But now it's time to move over (Time to move over)
I can see you're all for one but you don't give much of one for all
You're heading for a shock, heading for a fall
I think it's time to move over
It's time to move over (Time to move over)Embed
