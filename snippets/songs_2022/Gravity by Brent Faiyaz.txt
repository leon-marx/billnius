TranslationsPortuguesGRAVITY Lyrics
One-two, one-two (Yeah)

I'm on
But you want me home (Yeah)
I'd get you what you want (Ooh)
But you want me alone (I'm gone, baby, I'm active)
You held me up when I was down and out
But I don't want you waitin' 'round for me (She hold me down)
I don't want you waitin' too long (She hold me down)
I don't want you waitin' too long (Yeah, yeah)
She hold me down like gravity, we on the front page of them blogs
Would you be mad at me if the whole world knew the shit we was on?
It would be tragedy, my niggas be globe-trottin' like travel teams
You always in my travel dreams
Lace up to Three Stripes and I'm gone but you just want me home
Shorty hit my jack like, "What the fuck you doin'?"
Bitch, I'm all alone (She hold me down)
You gon' press me now?
Is you gon' stress me out and cuss me out?
I had my fair share of women, feelings don't catch me now (Down)

I'm on (Don't act like I'm average, come on)
But you want me home (Home)
I'd get you what you want (Superstar status)
But you want me alone (I'm gone, baby, I'm active)
You held me up when I was down and out
But I don't want you waitin' 'round for me (She hold me down)
I don't want you waitin' too long (She hold me down)

It's not that I'm over you, not over, girl (Come on)
But I got things to do
It's too much to be your boyfriend, too much
And you ain't making this much easier
If I only knew this
When I used to be your best friend
You see me blowin' up
You might also like
I'm on (Don't act like Im average, come on)
But you want me home (Home)
I'd get you what you want (Superstar status)
But you want me alone (I'm gone, baby, I'm active)
You held me up when I was down and out
But I don't want you waitin' 'round for me (She hold me down)
I don't want you waitin' too long (She hold me down)

Yeah, see, I'm a star, look at me from afar
Hard to be down to Earth, when you nestin' on Mars
You comet on how I move, too much space to assume (Keep sayin' shit)
But I'ma tell you the truth, shit
Now when I'm gone, and I roam 'round the globe for three months
That's too long without somethin' that's sweet
So I phone, little treats, that's a snack, not a feast
They don't mean much to me
'Cause I know that I have a bakery back at home
Am I wrong for (Come on, fuck)

I'm on (Don't act like Im average)
But you want me home (Home)
I'd get you what you want (Superstar status)
But you want me alone (I'm gone, baby, I'm active)
You held me up when I was down and out
But I don't want you waitin' 'round for me (She hold me down)
I don't want you waitin' too long (She hold me down)
I don't want you waitin' too long
You held me up when I was down and out
But I don't want you waitin' 'round for me (Down)
I don't want you waitin' too long (She hold me down)
I don't want you waitin' too long36Embed
