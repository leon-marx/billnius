Days That End In Why Lyrics
Been playin' twenty questions with twenty-four cans
24/7 til I understand
I sent a prayer up for a helpin' hand
But it musta got stopped by the ceilin fan
I'm starin at in this half-full bed
Lookin' for a reason that I ain't found yet

I know how a goodbye sounds when it's pedal down in taillight glow
I know what she said and I won't forget where she told me to go
But, hell, ever since them Goodyears pulled right out my dead grass drive
It's been nights that start with whiskey and days that end in "why"
Like why she finally threw in the towel
With her makeup bag and her hand-me-down earrings
And why she never felt the need
To tell me what I did, why she packed her things
And why she left me searchin' at the bottom of this bourbon

I know how a goodbye sounds when it's pedal down in taillight glow
I know what she said and I wont forget where she told me to go
But, hell, ever since them Goodyears pulled right out my dead grass drive
Its been nights that start with whiskey and days that end in "why"

Whether it's them "damn, I miss you" Tuesdays
That keep me up all night
Or them "take me way back" Wednesdays
That drift back through my mind

I know how a goodbye sounds when its pedal down in taillight glow
I know what she said and I won't forget where she told me to go
But, hell, ever since them Goodyears pulled right out my dead grass drive
It's been nights that start with whiskey and days that end in "why"
Aw, it's been nights that start with whiskey and days that end in "why"You might also likeEmbed
