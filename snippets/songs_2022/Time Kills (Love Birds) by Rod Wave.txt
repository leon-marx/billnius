Time Kills (Love Birds) Lyrics
(Fade)
(Tre made this beat)
(Ayy, pull up, Lam)

Lookin' for some happiness again, again, fame changed everything
Starin' at the walls in the dark, no, I don't sleep late at night
My new hood ain't like my old hood, but I still sleep with my fire
I don't get no sleep, I have nightmares of them takin' my life
Sometimes, I sit and remember
But my life was never simple
Do you remember 2014, when I was fourteen?
Locked up for lettin' that .44 sing, how you don't know me?
Break in your shit like I'm a dope fiend, duckin' the police
I had real kick-in-door dreams, this rap shit chose me
And I'm forever grateful, this shit changed my life
But so much came with this shit, I feel it can't be right
I'm always busy, always workin' how I'm 'posed to
Always keep my distance these days, can't be too social
I don't dot the door without my fire 'cause this shit dangerous
I don't want no bitch off IG live, she wanna be famous
How the fuck we went from love birds to strangers? Uh
Tell me how that work, girl? How's it feel to be my worst girl?
It's okay 'cause I know it get worse, girl
And dear, my soulmate, I know it's late to make amends, I
I guess it's safe to say that that's what time did
I tried to fix it, you were busy listenin' to your friends
Too famous to find love again
They say love hurts, 'cause love hurts, uh
Fame made love worse, yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah
They say time heals 'cause time heals
What about all the shit time killed?
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
Woah
Woah-woah, woah-woah
Woah-woah, yeahYou might also likeEmbed
