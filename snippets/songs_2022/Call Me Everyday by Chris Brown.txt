If I let you smoke, is you gon' lose my lighter?
If you paranoid, then I'ma spend the night
You talkin' that lovin' every day
Tell me nicely, use the money, I go pay

When you call, run it back on replay
For your love, I go pay, oh

Baby, every night say I go drive you psycho
Heavy, heavy duty, don dey make me mad, oh
Make you, make you sing, sing to the mic, oh
You're my queen, girl, you all that, lookin' in your eyes, oh
Show you many tings you can utilize, oh
If I say I love you, then I tell you like so (I love you)
Show you everything when I get in my zone (Yee)
True that, make you utilize, oh (Ooh)

Give you many tings wey go dey make you dance, oh
Gyal, make you back up to the standin' mic, oh
If his phone ring and he never call you back, you should leave him (Woo)
Let me put some money in your bag, you don't need him
What I mean is, if he do you bad, give me a reason
It ain't where you been, girl, it's where you at (Where you at)
