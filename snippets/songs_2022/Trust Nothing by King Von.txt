Bitch, why you tweakin' about shit ain't got shit to do with you? (What? What?)
When I get this check, ho, I swear that I'm through with you (Swear that I'm through)
Think you the only one? Bitch, it's a few of you (Bitch, it's a few)
I don't do one-on-ones, bitch, I need two of you (Huh? What? Nah, nah)

I'm holdin' her down, she can't do no runnin' (Yeah, yeah)
Her ass in the air, so I put my thumb in (I put my)
She say I'm the best, she know how I'm bomin' (She know how)

I ask her what's wrong and she say that it's nothin' (Say that it's nothin')
I know her too well, I know that it's somethin' (Nah, nah, I know that it's somethin')

Just bought me two Glocks and I'm keepin' 'em with me (I'm keepin' 'em with me)
That bitch broke your heart, got you roamin' the city (Boom)

But back to this bitch, she say that she with it (Say that she with)
She textin' my phone, she tell me, "Come get me" (She tell me, "Come get me")

Can't trust a bitch far as I can throw her (No)
Cap to me, said her daddy was a grower
Too good to be true when she told me the tea (Why?)
Didn't have no exotic, just locked up a midget
Got kicked out of school sellin' weed in the kitchen (Hmm?)
Snapback, white collar shirt, and some Dickies (Trap)
Quick to put me a bitch in detention
Ask Tavo, I been like this for a minute
The hood got too hot, so I moved to the 'burbs
Ferrari sit low, I step out on the curb (Skrrt)
She get off at five, then pull up at six
By seven, she ate me and already split (Uh)
Hope you not ready to die 'bout that bitch
'Cause this ho ready to go to war 'bout that dick (Swerve)
I keep two or three hoes, one too close to zero
Like NASCAR tires, I rotate a bitch

Bitch, why you tweakin' about shit ain't got shit to do with you? (What?)
When I get this check, ho, I swear that I'm through with you (Swear that I'm through)
