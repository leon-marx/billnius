Tequila Little Time Lyrics
Pardon me, I don't mean to pry
I saw the tears falling from your eyes, and I thought
You're too pretty not to wear a smile
Hope you don't mind if I sit down for awhile

'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too
We don't have to talk about the past
Here's to moving forward and not looking back
Little later, we can take it to the dance floor
But until then, let's order a couple more

'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too

It's good to see you laughin'
I guess this had to happen
Now let's just get to dancin'

'Cause I want tequila little time with you
A little salt and a lime will do
Hey bar man, will you bring us two?
I want tequila little time with you
Talkin' it all out
Seein' what you're all about
I hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too
You might also like
Hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too
Hope you're wantin' tequila little time with me too, oh2Embed
