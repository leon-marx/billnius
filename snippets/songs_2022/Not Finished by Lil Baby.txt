TranslationsPortuguesEspanolNot Finished Lyrics
They call me WHAM and they know who I am, yeah

She got that WAP and the way that she use it, saliva with top and she come with a mop
I need to stop, been out here rockin' the game with these features, it's over for niggas as soon as I drop
She lookin' for love, but my heart's away in the box, she trippin', I changed the locks
Never tell nobody, you seen me by myself, out and about, it was me and the Glock
Sun up to sundown, ain't nothin' else to do, but get money, so fuck it, I'm workin' the block
AP a cool quarter-million, I'm sorry, this watch and I come from me punchin' no clock
Build up some paper, got my number in motion and got me a spot and start workin' my flock
Why you keep textin' me "W-Y-D"? And "W-Y-A"? You givin' off cop
I told lil' bro if he can't get a knife, get a lock and a sock and just work what you got
I know for sure where she went, she'll go, I ain't cuffin' these hoes, like we swappin' 'em out
We really spin shit, I really did shit, I can't talk about, 'cause I'm not for the clout
They puttin' trackers on cars, watch your Insta', as soon as you dip, they gon' break in your house
Put Unc' in the chopper and mind if they ever come in, you better not let none of them get out
I be performin' whenever I'm in it, as soon as I nut, I should take me a bow
I done had this one, and this one, and this one and that one, like fuck it, let's fuck up the town
She super pretty and handle her business, like fuck all these bitches, I'm bustin' her down
She super friendly and like her a nigga who spend it, I'm tellin', I'm braggin' her around
She post a picture without my permission, got me in some shit, man, these women is wild
She fuckin' niggas, but think I don't know, that shit really a joke man, lil' mama's a clown
I know some hitters who dead the wrong, but they still came home, we took it to trial
Yeah, I'ma tell you when I'm finished (Never)
I get sturdy when I'm in it, baow
Talkin' 'bout I hurt her feelings, ouch
If I want it, I'ma get it now
Shooters in here, all the windows down
Oh you tryna get a bag, how?
Everybody know we pushin' them pounds, yeah

In here I go, I ain't walked in a minute
Fully in charge, I'm the boss of the business
And it's a problem, ain't callin' nobody, the hitters is already with me, I come from the heart of the city
The streets, I was all the way in 'em, I just dropped a banger with Nicki
My TRX talkin', I lifted it, soon as we harvest, they ship it, I just pray to God he forgive me
I've been out here killin' it
It was strong to go left, then I shifted it
You can come work for me, I got benefits
You can't do what I do, I invented this
.357 with a switch and extended clips
And another clip, that's a back-up
Stand out the way, I've been runnin' my sack up
I wish one of you pussy lil' niggas would add up
I bet we OD on 'em, bulletproof Cadillac
That's two-hundred racks, I told the set to go buy three of 'em
He thinkin' that he straight, 'cause I let him 'scape, I hope a nigga know that we on 'em
Heard they had the Cullinan, but ain't no comin' back, it is what it is
Get the quarterback and I'm the runnin' back, I get the team off the field
Look at my chain, it got bigger, change up the face, you look bitter
I hold it down for the real ones
I'm tryna pocket a billion, get out of line, you gon' feel me
When I get high, that's the real me, I know my opps wanna kill me
Ain't goin' nowhere, I'll be here
Post the location, we'll be there, get out of place and get beat up, brr (Bah, bah, bah)

Talkin' 'bout I hurt her feelings, ouch
If I want it, I'ma get it now
Shooters in here, all the windows down
Oh you tryna get a bag, how?
Everybody know we pushin' them pounds, yeah4Embed
