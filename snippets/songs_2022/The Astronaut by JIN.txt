You and me
  history
Oh,    
 
    
   
     dream
  story
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I get heaven to myself
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I feel this way I've never felt

You and me
  
  
 
    
    
     
   

When I'm with you
There is no one else
I get heaven to myself
When I'm with you
There is no one else
I feel this way I never felt
You might also like
I feel this way I never felt
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

When I'm with you
There is no one else
I get heaven to myself
When I'm with you
There is no one else
A life, a sparkle in your eyes
Heaven comin' through

And I love you
And I love you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh7Embed
