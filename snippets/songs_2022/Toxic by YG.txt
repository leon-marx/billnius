Toxic Lyrics
How can I love somebody else
If I can't love myself enough
To know when it's time
Time to let go?
Sing

All I really want (Yeah)
Is to be happy (Oh, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
It would be so sweet (Hey)
All I really want (Oh)
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
It would be so sweet
I know what she want, she want what's inside my jeans
She want my heart with the lock, she wanna throw away the key
She make lov, she don't get fucked, gang-gang got hr throwin' up Bs
She like, "Boy, don't do me wrong, just Birkin, Prada me"
As toxic as they come, but I really love her
Got her out here competin' with my baby mother
Bought her a new car, I be on her bumper
No, she can't see me leavin', she like Stevie Wonder
Late twenties, but with me she feel hella younger
Sugar daddies try to get her, she don't give her number
She need a vacay, she been dancin' all summer
Put you on a jet to Cabo, baby, I'm a stunner
I'm the plumber, get it wet, I clean it up (Clean it up)
Got designer for every season, keep her seasoned up (Seasoned up)
Don't post me on no Insta, gotta keep me tucked (Keep me tucked)
Treat her like a Queen, her friends think I'm mean as fuck
And when it come to pain, she run to meds
So don't break her heart, you gotta break her bed, ayy
Kill that pussy, hurt, she dead
Butt-naked in bed, is what she said

All I really want (Yeah)
Is to be happy (Oh, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
It would be so sweet (Hey)
All I really want (Oh)
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It would be so sweet
You might also like
Do you love her? Yeah, I really love her
She met my mother, cool with my brother (My brother)
We be doin' our thing, no Danny Glover
Like, fuck it, 'bout to have two baby mothers (Baby mothers)
Before you get dressed up, hit it on the dresser
I'm out here givin' love, pain and pleasure
Less is more, I don't never stress her
Tell her she a bad bitch, nothin' lesser
But she confused, she want titles and I tell her nah
She confused, us together is what she saw
She confused, 'cause I love her so that's what she thought
She's confused and that's 'cause I be in it raw
She confused and she tellin' me it's my fault
I said I love her, then I point out things that I brought
You knew from the gate I had family I won't shake
So stop bein' fake, tears fall from her face when I talk

All I really want (Yeah)
Is to be happy (Oh, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
It would be so sweet (Hey)
All I really want (Oh)
Is to be happy (I wanna be happy, yeah)
And to find a love that's mine (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It would be so sweet
Our father, the father of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob
The one that took two fish and five loaves of bread
And blessed a multitude of people
I come to you today, askin' you to give this young man courage
To do the right thing, give him strength, Lord
'Cause right now, he's out here breakin' hearts and makin' babies
So I feel the best for him and all those involved
Is to end all relationships
Give him wisdom to make the right decisions, LordEmbed
