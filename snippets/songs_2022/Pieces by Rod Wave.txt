Pieces Lyrics
Wasn't ready for it all
Autumn came and all the leaves, they had to fall
I've been waiting for a call
Just to be close to you
(B Squared beats)
Do you know what it's like to
Lose somebody like you?
I hear you when the wind blows
It follows me where I go
Do you know what it's like to
Lose somebody like you?
This shit don't feel right wrapped in my rage, oh (I hear you when the wind blows)
Uh, uh (Will-A-Fool)
You know my life just like a book how I'm turning the page
Reading our chapter hoping that I end in a change
You know this shit don't feel right wrapped in my rage, oh, yeah
You know I got you on my mind forevr so often
Looking back at it now, I can see how we lost it
In the coup behind tint on the way from New Orleans
You know I miss you on my side, but I'm fucking with shawty
But she gon' hate me when she find I'm the perfect pretender
I tried to find another bitch, I just look for you in her
And my hotel await in Houston, my happiness gone
Don't want no company right now, just leave me alone
I heard you found you a new friend, said they saw you in a Benz
All the bitches out your city at my neck tryna get in
I feel like it ain't fair you call it quits and get the Lyft
It's too late in the game for me to find true love again

I'm so gone before you go (What up?)
Think twice before leaving (Leaving)
'Cause hearts do not break even (Even)
Why am I still bleeding?
Gave you your heart back
Gave me mine back in pieces
In pieces (No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
In pieces, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm so gone before you go (Gone before you go)
Think twice before leaving (Yeah)
Hearts do not break even
Why am I still bleeding? (Still bleeding)
Gave you your heart back
Gave me my heart back in pieces
In pieces (Yeah)
Pieces, oh (Yeah, yeah, in pieces)
No, no, no, no, no, woah (In pieces, in pieces)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Yeah, yeah, oh)
Yeah, yeah
You might also like
I keep thinking 'bout the times we had
Now I'm stuck here without you
Wasn't ready for it all
Autumn came and all the leaves, they had to fall
I've been waiting for a call
Just to be close to youEmbed
