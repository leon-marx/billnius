TranslationsPortuguesEspanolDown In Atlanta Lyrics
Down in Atlanta, stayed at the Centerfold
Downstairs, my Aventador, you should've seen it
Down in Atlanta, at the Graveyard Tavern
You thought you seen a ghost, it's just where the Phantoms are
Shawty thicker than Kevlar (Yeah), it's wall to wall
Feel the heat through my drawers
I told shorty to bring the wave, you know life's a beach
She said, "Life's a bitch, let's hit Magic City"

Watch 'em fly from the sky, while we line up the wall
Like confetti how it falls, let 'em leave with it all
We ain't never been this high, the city big, feelin' small
Keep m wake, never off, four, four whn you
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Down in Atlanta, might just slide through the zone
Not talkin' LeBron home when I say I'm in Cleveland
Drown in my Fanta, Coke factory is my store
I mix it up how I pour, gotta see how I drink it
Woke up feeling like Fabo (Yeah), need a Georgia peach
Never run out of love or run out of weed
Daddy drivin' a tractor like a Hellcat or Demon
Hit two eighty-five, dashin', 'cause I'm lovin' the speed

Watch 'em fly from the sky (Sky), while we line up the wall
Like confetti how it falls, let 'em leave with it all
We ain't never been this high (High), the city big, feelin' small
Keep me wake, never off, four, four when you

Watch 'em-watch 'em fly, fly from the-from the sky

Down in Atlanta, just like Havana
Gotta get it on, gotta get it on
Gotta get it on, gotta get it on
Call up Miami, Atlantic, Atlantis
That how we get it on, how we get it on
How we get it on, how we get it on
You might also like
Watch 'em fly from the sky (Sky), while we line up the wall
Like confetti how it falls, let 'em leave with it all
We ain't never been this high (High), the city big, feelin' small
Keep me wake, never off, four, four when you7Embed
