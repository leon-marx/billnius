TranslationsEspanolPortuguesToo Late Lyrics
Too late for us
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

I been gone so long, I don't know where I'm going
You be on my phone, talkin' 'bout what's my problem?
Had to go alone to get it how I wanted
Had to be alone to figure out how I should be loved
And if it's just us, is that enough?
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared of love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

See, bust it like a toolie in your waistband
Bust it like that booty too big and you need two hands
Bust it like you catchin' a body and you in G stance
Bust it like it's casual Friday and you her to dance
Call bluff, I know what's up
Can't get enough
Is it bad that I want mor?

Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared of love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

Mmm, pressure, I won't learn my lesson
I want you to stretch it
Limit, want you to test it
I know I was born to roll
I gotta know
Is it bad that I want more?

Is it too late for us?
We both dangerous
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?
We both scared of love
Movin' so close, we combust
Is it bad that I want more?

So done with you
Nobody hurt me like you do
Every time you break my heart, it feel new
Every time I fall apart, I call you
I just wanna be loved
And loving you sucks
I can't get enough
Is it bad that I want more?
Is it too late for us?3Embed
