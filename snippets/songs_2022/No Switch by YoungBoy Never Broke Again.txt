No Switch Lyrics
Grr, bow, bow, bitch
These niggas hoes (Ayy, chase him)
You already know how I get down, you heard me?
These bitch ass niggas
You know how it turn out every time (You already know, bitch)
You heard me? I'm out that north (That Northside)
You heard me? Make pistols spark, you heard me?
(Bitch, it's 3800 block, you heard me?)
They be hard, you heard me?
(Bitch, come cross that track)
They be like Yamahas, you heard me?
(Cross that railroad)
.45 Glocks and shit
All these niggas talkin' 'bout them switches, choppa came automatic
Red flag, you know the business
Pop his ass, w drop his ass
That be that green flag activity
All these niggas talkin' 'bout killin' m
So bet, let's get it started
They know I been a murder man
We bust his brain, jump in that water
Hold on, swim like you a shark, bitch
Show him he a goldfish, show him how that pole hit
Walk down wit' that four-nick'
Hold on, talkin' bout that glizzy switch
My nigga, get your soul lit
Know you heard 'bout all these bodies, we be wildin'
That gravediggin' shit

Pallbearers bring your body to the grave (Mm-hmm)
Don't do no missin' wit' these K's, and that's on Dave (Mm-hmm)
Don't give a fuck about where you from
We leave you slumped, and that's on Dump
On bottom, the Draco got a drum
Come out the window, then we dump (Bow, bow)
Leave him dead, bro, don't call my phone
I'm bein' investigated by DOJ and the Feds
Slime gon' have the money, where you stay at?
I'm a child, that's how I play it
Watchin' 'toons while gettin' head
Backyardigans inside my bed
Then I switch to Bob the Builder
Take a bitch then body build her
They know I like bodies, I catch bodies wit' the slimest niggas
They know I be wildin', from my mama house, I shot a nigga
Fuck it, shoulda split his fitted
You might also like
All these pussy niggas talkin' 'bout them switches, this choppa came automatic
Red flag, you know the business
Pop his ass, we drop his ass
That be that green flag activity
All these niggas talkin' 'bout killin' me
So bet, let's get it started
They know I been a murder mane
We bust his brain, jump in that water
Hold on, swim like you a shark, bitch
Show him he a goldfish, show him how that pole hit
Walk down wit' that four-nick'
Hold on, talkin' bout that glizzy switch
My nigga, get your soul lit
Know you heard 'bout all these bodies, we be wildin'
That gravediggin' shit

Shawty got that ass, that's my lil' baby, I buy her a bottle
Don Julio, plus my lil' four, he got all them narcotics
1942, or pour a four, I go to diddy boppin'
Makeup on my face, or either way, bitch, you don't want my problems
They know I'm gon' see about it
They know I don't give no fuck
They know they don't want to see Lul Tim jump from out that truck
They know Quando rollin' like them 60s, buck, he put you up
Know I'm a thug ass nigga out that north, and I'ma throw it up
And I'm in this bitch, I whacked that bitch but innocent
I buy my babymama anything, bitch, 'cause I'm really rich
I pull up on that silly shit, I'm laughin', but it turn out bad
Try to fight me, I'ma pop you daddy
4MATIC, you can catch me in that Maybach flashin'
This choppa came automatic
Red flag, you know the business
Pop his ass, we drop his ass
That be that green flag activity
All these niggas talkin' 'bout killin' me
So bet, let's get it started
They know I been a murder mane
We bust his brain, jump in that water
Hold on, swim like you a shark, bitch
Show him he a goldfish, show him how that pole hit
Walk down wit' that four-nick'
Hold on, talkin' bout that glizzy switch
My nigga, get your soul lit
Know you heard 'bout all these bodies, we be wildin'
That gravediggin' shit

Nigga, I'm way from the South, bitch
I'm from the bottom of the-
I'm from the bottom of the motherfuckin' United States
You heard me?
We ain't nothin' but some alligators, you heard me
Some rapper slayers, you already know, 4
You know it, whole lot of convicts and shit (Haha)
Pussy ass nigga, they don't like me
Bitch, I don't like you neither2Embed
