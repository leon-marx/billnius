Pick Me Up Lyrics
(Mm)

It's been one of those days I don't wanna do twice
No matter what I say, it doesn't come out right
I need one of those nights where you slide me close
'Til we're off the map and you're makin' me laugh
I don't care if we ever go home

So pick me up
Get me lost way out, down a back two-lane, little George Strait
Way on up
Get me outta my head and outta this town
And tell me no matter what
You'll be by my side, everything gonna be alright
Make th world go black how you do me like that
When I climb up in your truck, just pick m up, mm
We could ride on past every one-light street
Watch a full moon crash on some sunrise wheat
You can kiss me fast and drive real slow
That old Chevy made, take as long as it takes
You and Jesus will fix my soul

So pick me up
Get me lost way out, down a back two-lane, little George Strait
Way on up
Get me outta my head and outta this town
And tell me no matter what
You'll be by my side, everything gonna be alright
Make the world go black how you do me like that
When I climb up in your truck, just pick me up

Mm, yeah
Just pick me up
Ooh

Get me lost way out, down a back two-lane, little George Strait
Way on up
Get me outta my head and outta this town
And tell me no matter what
You'll be by my side, everything gonna be alright
Make the world go black how you do me like that
When I climb up in your truck, just pick me up
You might also like
Mm, yeah
Just pick me up (Mm)
