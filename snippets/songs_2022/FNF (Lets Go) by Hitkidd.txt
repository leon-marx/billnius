F.N.F. (Lets Go) Lyrics
(Hitkidd, what it do, man?)
Glorilla
Let's go
Woo, woo, hey
On gang

I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (Fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheatin' (Woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (Yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends (Let's go)
I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (Fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheatin' (Woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (Yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends (Let's go)
Like let's go (Go, go, go, go)
Let's go (Go, go, go, go)
Let's go (Go, go, go, go)
Let's go (Go, go, go, go)

Bitch, I'm G to the L to the O, Big Glo ('Rilla)
You can catch me out in traffic tinted, slidin' with your ho (Skrrt)
I ain't poppin' out at parties, gotta book me for a show (Give me that)
He say, "Y'all be living fast," nah, pussy boy, you slow (Stupid ass)
Ayy, we hoppin' out in red lights (Go), twerkin' on them headlights (Go)
She say she can't come outside today, that mean she scared, right? (Huh?)
I be put up in the winter, in the summer, pop out every night (On gang)
Braggin' on that nigga top, you better hold his head tight (Better watch him)
Anyways, life's great, pussy still good (But they knew that)
Still eatin' cake, wishin' that a bitch would (Bet they won't)
Got my foot up on they necks as a bitch should (Watch me plot, let's go)
On gang

I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (Fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheatin' (Woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (Yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends (Let's go)
I'm F-R-E-E, fuck nigga free (Fuck 'em)
That mean I ain't gotta worry 'bout no fuck nigga cheatin' (Woo)
And I'm S-I-N-G-L-E again (Yup)
Outside hanging out the window with my ratchet-ass friends (Let's go)
