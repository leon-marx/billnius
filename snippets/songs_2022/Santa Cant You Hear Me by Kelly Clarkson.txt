Santa, Cant You Hear Me Lyrics
Keep the snow and sleigh rides
Keep those silver bells
Keep the gifts beneath the tree
Give them to someone else
Keep that magic snowman
Keep those twinkly lights
Keep the reindeer
My heart already knows how to fly (Mm)

'Cause all I ever wanted
Was nothin I got and
Santa, can't you hear me?
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
I don't need a thing
I sent a letter to you, ooh, ooh
On how to make my dreams come true, yeah, yeah
What I want for Christmas
Hasnt come and I been so blue
Tell me what can I do? Ooh, ooh, oh yeah
Keep the mistltoe (Keep the mistleto)
Unless below, is what I need (What I need)
Santa, can't you hear me?

Keep those bows and boxes (Keep them bows and them boxes)
Keep those three wise men
No need for a North star to show me where I will end

'Cause all I ever wanted
Isn't on a shelf and
Santa, can't you hear me?
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh (Ooh yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I don't need a thing
I sent a letter to you, ooh, ooh
On how to make my dreams come true, oh-woah
What I want for Christmas
Hasn't come and I been so blue
Tell me what can I do? Ooh, ooh, oh yeah
Keep the mistletoe
Unless below, is what I need
Oh, Santa, can't you hear me? (Yeah)

Cause all I ever wanted
Was nothing I got and
Santa, cant you hear me?
There's one thing that I need
Oh-oh, oh, oh (Ooh yeah)
Oh, oh (Ooh yeah)
Oh, oh (Santa, baby)

I dont need a thing
I sent a letter to you, ooh, ooh (You, ooh, ooh)
On how to make my dreams come true, oh-woah
What I want for Christmas
Hasn't come and I been so blue
Tell me what can I do? Ooh, ooh, oh yeah
Keep the mistletoe
Unless below, is what I need, oh
Santa, can't you hear me?1Embed
