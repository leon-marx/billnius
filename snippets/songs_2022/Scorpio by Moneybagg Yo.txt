Scorpio Lyrics
Bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want)
Is you with me, or what? Think I'm trying to get me a nut (All I want is you)
Just 'cause honeys wanna give me (Oh, oh)

(All that I want is you)
Love done made her heart cold as Minnesota (All that I want is you)
Hard to tell, I can't figure out her motive (All that I want is you)
It's the small things, don't take much to win her over (All that I want is you)
Stack all summer 'cause her birthday in October
What type of games are bein' played? How's it goin' down? (All I want is you)
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want is you, oh-oh-oh)

Got a nigga but get out of her body 'cause who I am (Bagg)
She fuck me with her yes, then bite hr lips sayin', "Zamn" (Ooh)
What really made me like her, she ain't do too much like Pam (A vibe)
One night, she cook for me, next day I'm blocked on Instagram (Damn, woah)
Let me find out that she did me like I do these hoes (Karma)
Was committed to old boy, tryna play her role (Trauma)
Some months go past, I ain't talk to her, ain't seen her (What's up?)
Asked her how she been, she like, "I'm outside, and I'm single" (It's up)
So you know I spinned the block (Shot my shot), like we do opps
When it's soft, she get it rock
Wake up, fuck, then go shop (Splurge)
And I don't care 'bout who had it before me, it's my go (My turn)
They droppin' salt like, "She a ho," so, she my ho
If I violate first, no doubt, she gon' violate worse (It get back)
If it don't work out, I guess it just ain't our time
I'ma probably show you I'm solid first and if the energy ain't right
I'ma show you how easy it is to cut ties, no more tries (Gone)

(All that I want is you)
Love done made her heart cold as Minnesota (All that I want is you)
Hard to tell, I can't figure out her motive (All that I want is you)
It's the small things, don't take much to win her over (All that I want is you)
Stack all summer 'cause her birthday in October (All that I want is you)
Love done made her heart as cold as Minnesota (All that I want is you)
Hard to tell, I can't figure out her motive (All that I want is you)
It's the small things, don't take much to win her over (All that I want is you)
Stack all summer 'cause her birthday in October

I ain't saying that you can't do what you wanna do
It's on 'til it's gone, then I gots to know now (All I want is you, oh-oh-oh)
I just ain't going for it, haha

She go from one nigga to the next one, movin' around fast
Don't love dude (Uh-uh), she just do that, think it make me mad
Stubborn, aggressive, possessive and jealous, it's more than that
Tellin' me his sex ain't good as mine while I hit from the back
Sittin' inside the car, this ho just talkin', think she sellin' me dreams
I had to look twice, I seen my nigga number 'cross her screen
Last situation scarred her so she movin' off hurt
I can't save her, I got out of there, I ain't makin' nothin' work (I'ma exit)
Ain't no second-guessin', I be goin' off what I know (Can't fool me)
Talking 'bout that's your bestie, y'all be fuckin' on the low (I knew it)
She sneaky and she freaky, I looked up her horoscope (It said)
To be continued, this a story 'bout a Scorpio
