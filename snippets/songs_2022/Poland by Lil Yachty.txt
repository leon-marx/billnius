You fuckin' with that, F1LTH'? (Wake up, F1LTHY)
To Poland

I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to Poland

Uh (Phew, phew), ha

Ride around with a Kel-Tec (Wock')
If you mean it, baby girl, do you mean it?
I been leaning, baby girl, I been leaning (Wock')
Phew, phew, phew (Wock')
Phone still ringing, battling all my demons
I been fiending, baby girl, I been fiending (Wock')
Hope you love me, baby, I hope you mean it (Wock')
I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to Poland
I took the Wock' to PolandYou might also like52Embed
