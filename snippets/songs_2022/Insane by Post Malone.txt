TranslationsTurkceEspanolInsane Lyrics
(Yeah, we want to go insane)

Take your bitch, give her back, insane
Sent her packing, she was actin' crazy
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
I'm a bachelor, I'm a bastard, hey (Wow)
Don't believe me? You can ask her, hey
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
Bring that ass, meet me back stage
A million racks, I need it cash, cake
Yeah, we both got a car, but it's different
Yeah, we both got a house, but it's different
Yah, we both got teeth, but it's different
(Both got teeth, both got teeth, yah)
I wanna see somethin' in a short skirt, please
I wanna see somethin' in a shirt skort, please (Wow)
Treat my top like my ex, I'ma cut it off completely
Treat my top like my ex, I'ma cut it off completely (Skrrt skrrt)

Take your bitch, give her back, insane (Wow)
Sent her packing, she was actin' crazy
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range (Wow)
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
I'm a bachelor, I'm a bastard, hey (Wow)
Don't believe me? You can ask her, hey
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range (Ooh)
She was classy, now she nasty, hey (Wow)

Second verse, second verse, yay
Second verse, second verse, again
Put her on game, this is not the same though
This is a Mulsanne, diamonds make a rainbow
Keep my Glocky tucked like a baby in a manger
When your girl around me, she treat you like a stranger
I got 20, 30 strippers in the Sprinter van
It's a little cramped to try to teach me how to dance
Ooh, you talkin' that shit, but
You ain't gonna do shit, ooh (Gonna do shit, ooh)
I ain't even gotta get up (Get it)
Ain't nobody scared of you, ooh (Damn)
You might also like
Take your bitch, give her back, insane (Wow)
Sent her packing, she was actin' crazy
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range
She was classy, now she nasty, hey
I'm a bachelor, I'm a bastard, hey (Wow)
Don't believe me? You can ask her, hey
Goin' batshit in the backseat, range (Wow)
She was classy, now she nasty, hey (Hey)6Embed
