Home Sweet Lyrics
Home sweet

Touching down, from a six night honeymoon
Sun kissed kids, still drunk on love
Went from, all-inclusive margaritas in Malibu
To praying we could pay rent this month

That doormat says "Welcome Home"
But I think it's wherever Im with you
It's more than some bricks and stones
No, there ain't nothing like
Home sweet, you and me
Aint got much but we got all we need
Wherever the wind blows
Wherever this life goes
Baby, all I know, ain't nothing like, nothing like
Home sweet
You and me

Your love is like, a porch swing on Sunday
Just as gentle as a summer sunrise
They say "It's where the heart is", well, mine's with you, babe
Long as I got your hand, I'm fine, yeah

Could be white brick and picket fences
Or some busted AC hotel room
It's all picture perfect if you're in it
No, it don't get much better than

Home sweet, you and me
Aint got much but we got all we need
Wherever the wind blows
Wherever this life goes
Baby, all I know, aint nothing like, nothing like
Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like)
You and me (Nothing like, nothing like)
Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like)
You and me (Nothing like, nothing like)
You might also like
A quarter acre and a two-bed farmhouse
Polaroid kiss, with the red sold sign
Sitting on boxes in the living room laughing and crying
Just staring at them two pink lines, huh
Ooh yeah
Time to make a little more room in our

Home sweet, you and me
Yeah, we got it all and you're still all I need
Wherever the wind blows
Wherever this life goes
Baby, all I know, aint nothing like, nothing like
Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like)
You and me (Nothing like, nothing like)
Home sweet (Nothing like, nothing like)
You and me, yeah (Nothing like, nothing like)

Nothing like, nothing like
Nothing like, nothing likeEmbed
