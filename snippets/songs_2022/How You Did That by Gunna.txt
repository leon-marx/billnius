(Playmakers)
Say Gunna Wunna
(Run that back, Turbo)
I'm gonna wanna fuck her too

Shell catcher on a AR
How you did that?
Trackhawk lift up when you take off
How you did that?
You put switches all on your blickies
How you did that?
Your LV bag turned to a Learjet
How you did that?
I seen that duck turn to a Louis
How you did that?
That look like a brand new booty
How you did that?
You got fake stones in a real watch
How you did that?
You hid some skeletons in yo' closet
Why you did that?
How you yelling, "Slatt"? (Slatt)
How I kill a cat? Yeah
Hop in and run in a two-tone Maybach, pillows in the back (Let's go)
Too many vibes, and it's fully AK, someone gon' get whacked (Shh)
How you go get more weed? You still owe me, how you gon' do that?
Snatch a Ruger bag, give a nigga Yak attack
I get my shooter whacked, you eatin' cheese then that's a rat
"It ain't nighttim but your chain glow, how you do that shit?"
Me and Gunna fuck the same ho, how you knw that bih? (How you do that shit?)

Shell catcher on a AR
How you did that? (How you did that?)
Trackhawk lift up when you take off
How you did that? (Skrrt)
You put switches all on your blickies
How you did that?
Your LV bag turned to a Learjet
How you did that?
I seen that duck turn to a Louis
How you did that?
That look like a brand new booty
How you did that?
You got fake stones in a real watch
How you did that?
You hid some skeletons in yo' closet
Why you did that?

They hit your man, you ain't get no shaming, how you live with that?
She fucked the whole hood, how you lay and have a kid with that?
Margiela gold toes match the Hublot, yeah, I did that
Kick more shit than judo, and she like how I did that
How you get that shit? You got a magnet on your hoes
Matte black Maybach, sick
Bitch, I'm too rich, it got me rude (Uh)
Pop my shit like plumber, me and Gunna's diamonds flush (Uh)
I'm gon' ball all summer, just off grindin' for a month (Ayy)
Pull up, hop out, dunk

Shell catcher on a AR
