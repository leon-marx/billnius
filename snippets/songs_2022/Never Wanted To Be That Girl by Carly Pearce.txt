Never Wanted To Be That Girl Lyrics
He helped me change a tire in the Citgo parking lot
He said we both could use a beer
And I said "Hell, why not?"
What started out as one night turned to six months just like that
He never had a ring on
So I never thought to ask

But then last night I saw a message on his phone
That said "Hey babe, what time you comin' home?"
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Being "The Other One" when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
Thought I knew who I was but it's getting hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl

I heard about those women who didn't have a clue
The ones that made excuses like my mama used to do
And he jumps in the shower just as soon as he gets home
And I spend half an hour going through his phone

I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Being "The Other One" when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was but it's getting hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl

Oh and I feel stupid
I feel cheap
I feel used
I feel weak
You might also like
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to hate myself
I thought this kind of lonely only happens to somebody else
Being "The Other One" when there's another one
God, this feels like hell
I thought I knew who I was but it's getting hard to tell
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to be that girl
I never wanted to be that girl2Embed
