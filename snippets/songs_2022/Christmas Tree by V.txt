Christmas Tree Lyrics

In this moment I see you
It always comes around as I believed
When the rain stops you shine on me
Your light's the only thing that keeps the cold out
Moon in the summer night
Whispering of the stars
They're singing like Christmas trees for us
So, I'll tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are

It's such a strange thing to do
Sometimes I don't understand you
But it always brings me back
To where you are


 
    
  
      
 
 
 

You might also like
So, I'll tll you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gts tangled up inside
And I'll tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are
Tell you
A million tiny things that
You have never known
It all gets tangled up inside
Tell you
A million little reasons
I'm falling for your eyes
I just want to be where you are28Embed
