TranslationsEspanolPortuguesGone Girl Lyrics
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Split mind, don't need to decide when
Straightforward, eyes on the climbin'
I decide no matter the climate
Birthin' bitches in my third trimester
Shift eyes, they tell me you lyin'
Don't care, just lay here beside me
Hang time chasin' the rewind
Hang time
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (Just you and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me
Boy, you're losin'

Gone, gone, girl, gon, girl
You better learn how to fac it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replace her
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl

Can't think, it's too hard to process
Get around you and I regress
I decide what demons I digest
I'm just tired of repeatin', I digress
Tryna find deeper meanin' in nonsense
Tryna grow without hatin' the process
Tired of anticipating the worst yet
Still anticipating the worst (Worst)
You might also like
I need more space and security (Security)
I need less voices, just you and me (You and me)
I need your touch, not your scrutiny (Scrutiny)
Squeezin' too tight, boy, you're losin' me
Boy, you're losin'

Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
Never replace her
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl

Inward I go when there's no one around me
And memories drown me, the further I go
And ain't nobody talkin' 'bout the damage, pretendin' like it's all okay
I tried to erase, I live to escape

Gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl
She's gone, gone, girl, gone, girl
You better learn how to face it
She's gone, gone, girl, so gone, girl6Embed
