Miss You Lyrics
Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care?
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else, it could be anyone else out there

Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I nver wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen ovr and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
Don't remind me
I'm mindin' my own damn business
Don't try to find me
I'm better left alone than in this
It doesn't surprise me
Do you really think that I could care?
If you really don't like me
Find somebody else, it could be anyone else out there

Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
It'll happen again
I watch it happen over and over again
Don't fret
I don't ever wanna see you
And I never wanna meet you again
One thing
When you're angry, you're a jerk
And then you treat me like I'm worth nothin'You might also like12Embed
