Sexy motherfucker, you the baddest one (Woah)
Gave you all my love, that shit been addin' up (Woah)
We should get away somewhere and run it up (Woah)
You tryna fall in love (Oh)
Need you to bring all of your friends and let's fuck it up (Fuck)
I know you ain't been touched enough (Enough)
I know you ain't the only one, no (One)
Need you to bring all of your friends and let's fuck it up (Fuck)
I know you ain't been touched enough (Touched enough, enough)
I know you ain't the only one
See you with your friends, you got a
Brand new Benz, you got a
Nigga blowin' up your phone, you ain't thinkin' 'bout him
She just wanna turn up with her girls, get the stress off
And I just wanna take her to the room, get that dress off
Even though I'm in a good mood, I fuck you like I'm pissed off
And don't give me no attitude, you gon' make my dick soft
Heard she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm lit now ('Cause I'm lit now)
Yeah, heard she wanna fuck me 'cause I'm rich now ('Cause I'm rich now)
We can link after the club, I got a penthouse
Second 'til I shoot it, it comes so fast, I made her get down

She got new ass and new titties, she a ten now
She got new ass and new titties, she a ten now
Sexy motherfucker

Sexy motherfucker, you the baddest one (Woah)
Gave you all my love, that shit been addin' up (Woah)
We should get away somewhere and run it up (Woah)
I'm tryna fall in love (Oh)

She got new ass and new titties, she a ten now (Yeah)
She got new ass and new titties, she a ten now (Toni)
Sexy motherfucker

You know I got your back, baby (Back)
We ain't gotta talk about it (Right)
Your booty stickin' out, they gotta walk around it
Take my queen to King of Diamonds (Mm)
PJ, I switch the climate
It ain't no seat assignment
Doze off, wake up on an island (Yeah)
I bring your friends so y'all can fuck it up (Fuck it up)
Rolls and a couple truck
I bought a couple zips
I brought some Molly and some shrooms, you think we flew here?
Oh, we gon' really trip (Trip)
Pussy on fingertips (Mm)
Yeah, I'ma kiss them lips
I'm talkin' both of 'em (Both of 'em)
I told her, "Ride this dick and I'm the chauffeur"
I hit it from the side, then I make her fall off
Pussy too wet for me to fuck you on my sofa
Mess it up (Yeah)

(Sexy) Sexy motherfucker, you the baddest one (Woah, baddest)
Gave you all my love, that shit been addin' up (Woah, it's been addin', baby)
We should get away somewhere and run it up (Run it up)
I'm tryna fall in love (Oh)
Need you to bring all of your friends and let's fuck it up (Fuck it up, fuck it up, woah)
I know you ain't been touched enough (Fuck it up, fuck it up)
I know you ain't the only one, no (Yeah, fuck it up, fuck it up, woah)
Need you to bring all of your friends and let's fuck it up (Fuck it up, fuck it up, woah)
I know you ain't been touched enough (Oh, oh, no)
I know you ain't the only one (Sexy motherfucker)
