TranslationsEnglishBIG TIME Lyrics
Rainbow Audemar, 'cause my bitch bisexual
(We the Best Music)
Posters in the projects, lot of foreign cars
(GOD DID, DJ Khaled)

Rainbow Audemar, bitch, I'm big time
Twenty-four hour security guard, bitch, I'm big time
I got more than one main bitch, 'cause I'm big time
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time
I just left my video, the feds was watchin'
Posted in the hood, they sent the helicopter
Bad bitch on call, got my money right
Just left from Booby Trap, had a money fight

It don't make sense, it don't make dollars (Don't make dollars)
A different breed, I'm far from normal (Far from normal)
I'm takin' a check and flippin' it, like I know gymnastics
Can't post my dawgs on IG, because they too active
Level up, level up, ain't never gon' stop
Level up, level up (Listen)
King Pluto, I wouldn't be nothin' without this trappin' shit
Yeah, I even gave a bitch a facelift

Rainbow Audemar, bitch, I'm big time
Twenty-four hour security guard, bitch, I'm big time
I got more than one main bitch, 'cause I'm big time
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time

I just left my video, the feds was watchin'
Posted in the hood, they sent the helicopter
Bad bitch on call, got my money right
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time

Birdman, Manny Fresh, gang, bro, we big time
I'm rockin' out with who I rock with, and I don't gotta pick sides
We don't talk 'bout nothin', I don't gotta switch lines
It didn't take that long, ran this money up in real time
Make sure everybody eat, girl, fuck how they feel 'bout it
Please don't kill my vibe, I don't wanna hear about it
Dark shades cover my eyes, ain't tryna see everybody
'Rari cost nine twenty-five, still drive like I don't care about it
I'm too slimy, you can't hold me (Big slime)
She just jokin', bitch don't know me (Quit lyin')
Maybach glossy like it just got (Spit shined)
Might come fast, might come slow, bet I get mine

Rainbow Audemar, bitch, I'm big time
Twenty-four hour security guard, bitch, I'm big time
I got more than one main bitch, 'cause I'm big time
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time (Big slime)
Rainbow Audemar, bitch, I'm big time
Twenty-four hour security guard, bitch, I'm big time
I got more than one main bitch, 'cause I'm big time
She went and tatted my name, because I'm big time

Another one
Streets show love, I show love back
(Twenty-four hour security guard, I'm big time)
Smokin' on this gas, feel like the pain (Feel like the pain)
(Try my gang with my gang, nigga, we big time)3Embed
