I'm fuckin' a bitch in a pent' (Ski)
I'm fuckin' a bitch in a Patek (Ski, ski)
I fucked a lil' bitch on the couch (Ski)
We fuckin' all over the house (Mop)

She said, "Ain't no teeth on ya cock" (Yeah)
You took the words right out of my mouth (Mop)
I took the bitch out of her county
Then dropped the bitch off in the South (Mop)
I nutted all over her face (Mop)
And now she look like a cow (Mop)
Let's go to Saint-Tropez (Mop)
This bitch 'bout to sprint out the house, pew (Mop)
