TranslationsPortuguesEspanolTurkceLock On Me Lyrics
Yeah
Yeah

Playin' with yourself and poppin' pills
Had a long night, but need some more in me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me
Made it off the block into the hills
Slidin' in the Palms, got a four with me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me (Hahaha)
Knocked down that bitch, put a Glock on the switch
Passing out these pills, I done told y'all how to kill 'em
I done told y'all how to flip it, I done told y'all how to dress
I done told y'all how to pimp it (How to pimp it)
Designer my clothes, I designer my girl
Money, more mud, I mix codeine on hr
From the bando to Tokyo, different flavor
Strappd with a pole and I'm talkin' with my chest out
Hang with the bros, we in Turks with the best of 'em
Somethin' like a pro athlete, the way I crossed over
Trap nigga, extravaganza, I told you
One, two, three Phantoms pullin' up and I showed you
Mud in my drink, I got mud on my shoulder (On my shoulder)
Cookin' models up, poppin' bottles up
I'm a nuisance, got the coupe in it, go and spin it
Gotta wear diamonds, like it's a part of my religion

Playin' with yourself and poppin' pills
Had a long night, but need some more in me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me
Made it off the block into the hills
Slidin' in the Palms, got a four with me
Had to switch the form got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me
You might also like
Somethin' gettin' got, I gotta give
Either way it go, you know, it is what it is
Flip flop the soda, 'til it mix with the fizz
Try to Payola, that's a stitch in the biz'
I've been in, holed up, cookin' hits at the Ritz
Got a couple comin' over for visits from the strip
Love to come over for events to get bent
You leave with all your sins and then you try to repent (Yeah)

Mixin' Wockesha, mixin' Wockesha
Pour another liter, now I gotta eat her
Now I gotta eat her

Playin' with yourself and poppin' pills
Had a long night, but need some more in me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me
Made it off the block into the hills
Slidin' to the Palms, got a four with me
Had to switch the form, got a new technique
Had to get it goin', put a lock on me

Made it to the block to the hills
Ain't answer my thoughts on these pills
Push up through the block, poppin' a seal
I got drip on me that ain't for sale
I get it, I'm a boss, pushin' 'til it ain't no limit
I spit in my bitch mouth, tell her "Keep hoes out our business"
Got an iced out lil' cross, but ain't doin' no repentin'
Money stuck to me, like it's lint
(Metro)
