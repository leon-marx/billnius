New Truck Lyrics
I need a new truck
There ain't nothing wrong with mine
It's got forty something thousand miles
And the engine runs just fine
No, it ain't tore up
Ain't got a scratch, ain't got a dent
The radio the works, it don't show dirt
Worth every dime I spent

I was gonna drive it
Till the wheels fell off
Yeah, that was before she slammed the door
Said it's over, then got lost
I need one she ain't climbed up in
That ain't played her favorite songs
Need some glass that we ain't fogged up
That her bare feet ain't been on
I need a hood that we ain't laid on
Kissing till that sun came up
That's all that's wrong with this one
If you're looking, you're in luck
I need a new truck

Yeah, I need it right now
Not tomorrow ,not next week
Can't take another red light
With her memory over in that seat
If I find one more
Hair tie that slipped off her wrist
One more chapstick, one more picture
I might push it off a bridge

I need one she ain't climbed up in
That ain't played her favorite songs
Need some glass that we ain't fogged up
That her bare feet ain't been on
I need a hood that we ain't laid on
Kissing till that sun came up
That's all that's wrong with this one
If you're looking you're in luck
I need a new truck
You might also like
Nah, I didn't wreck it
But it might as well be
Sitting on blocks in some old shop
The way that girl wrecked me

I need one she ain't climbed up in
That ain't played her favorite songs
Need some glass that we ain't fogged up
That her bare feet ain't been on
I need a hood that we ain't laid on
Kissing till that sun came up
That's all that's wrong with this one
If you're looking you're in luck
I need a new truck
Yeah, I need a new truck
Yeah, I need a new truckEmbed
