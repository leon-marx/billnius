TranslationsEspanolPortuguesNotice Me Lyrics
You stay on my mind, I can't regret no times spent with you
And I still wonder if you notice me, yes
Out of my line if I box with you
Out of my line if I check your line when you're not around
Out of my lane if I get beside myself, I can't rock with you
Can't decide right now
Either way I'm bustin' through tonight with you

Top down in the C3, speedin' way to you
Yes, sir, when you see me, toot that thing like
All of this and more when you 'bout me
All of this and joy will surround you
Long as you got me
I don't wanna be your girlfriend
I'm just tryna be your person
I don't need to be your girl, uh
Cool with just bein' your person, uh
Already tried to be your girl
We can't ven speak, but you stay on my mind
I can't regrt no times spent with you
And I still wonder if you notice me, yes

If I had a dime or two
For that cheap shit you be spittin', I'll provide the mood
It's cool, but you be jockin' me for all my jewels
Damn, fan nigga
Hit it then lost your mind, hmm, I understand, man
Said all of this and more
Finna take me a ride to the shore now
Finna sign me some lines, need insurance
I can't lack niggas, can't hang, I just get more real, oh

I don't wanna be your girlfriend
I'm just tryna be your person
I don't need to be your girl, uh
Cool with just being your person, uh
Already tried to be your girl
I'ma get the dick that I deserve, yeah, yeah
Try to flip on me, I hit you where it hurts, yeah, yeah
Tried to wife you, but you'd rather be a ho, yeah
So I spit this shit to let these niggas know, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
