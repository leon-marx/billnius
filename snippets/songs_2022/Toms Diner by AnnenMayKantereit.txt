Toms Diner Lyrics
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

I am sitting in the morning at the diner on the corner
I am waiting at the counter for the man to pour the coffee
And he fills it only halfway and before I even argue
He is looking out the window at somebody coming in

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
"It is always nice to see you", says the man behind the counter
To the woman who has come in, she is shaking her umbrella
And I look the other way as they are kissing their hellos
And I'm pretending not to see them and instead I pour the milk

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Oh no, it is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is always nice to see you
It is al-al-always nice
Al-al-always nice
It is always nice to see you
Always nice to see you
It is al-al-always nice
Oh, it is al-al-always nice

Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

Oh, it is always nice to see you
Always nice
It is always nice to see you
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
(Oh, it is always nice to see you)
(Always nice to see you)
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo5Embed
