Woo, woo, woo, woo
Woo, woo, let's go

Panoramic, bitch, I can see right through it (See it)
Smokin' on cookie, it's gas, manure (Woah)
Damn, threw fifty racks in a lure (Damn)
Know we gon' run with the pack like a wolf (Go)
Thug Life on me like I'm Tupac Shakur (Thug)
Thirty-five K for the seats on the floor (Racks)
Yes, I'm the wave, but don't got a shore (Ha)
Starin' at me, but I don't want the whore (No)
Skrrt, almost had crashed the 'Rari (Skrrt)
Jump off the top of the rope like Jeff Hardy (Go)
Niggas be broke and be ready to party
Nike Mags on, man, I'm feelin' like Marty (Woo)
'Scuse me, bitch, don't you be walkin'? ('Scuse me)
Don't got no money, so you shouldn't be talkin'
DM'ing me, bitch, you know I ain't talkin' (Hah)
My bitch find out, she gon' kill 'em, white chalk 'em (Uh)
Shh, it's a dead man (Dead man)
Rocks on my neck like the Flintstone, I'm Bam Bam
Ran up them M's and I bought me the Lamb' Lamb'
She on my dick, want a pic, she a fan-fan
Postin' these racks but I know it's a scam (Scam)
Don't cuff a bitch, I'm not selfish, I share 'em (Share 'em)
Elliot pink diamonds lookin' like Cam (Pink)
He actin' tough but he sweeter than yams (Sweet)
Two bitches in a Rolls Ghost and it scare 'em (Two)
I collect shoes and I don't even wear 'em (Nah)
Twenty-five million, I get overwhelmed
Hello (Hello?)
I want that kitty, I like bitches thick with them lil' bitty titties
I like bitches rich and they know how to get it (Go)
Come from the dark, my wrist and neck is litted (Ice)
Never quit it
You niggas was hatin', wait in line, I'm shittin' (Wait)
You niggas was hatin', wait in line, I'm shittin'
You niggas was hatin', wait in line, I'm shittin' (Let's go)
Ew, that's nasty, bitch can't catch me (Catch me)
I'm in the Lambo', this bitch nasty
This a wide body and the rims look ashy (Woo)
How did this happen? Rich nigga habit (Rich)
Niggas ain't eatin' and they blame it on fastin' (Hey)
Fresh to death like I jumped out a casket (Casket)
Before the COVID-19, we was maskin' (Get 'em)
When I say spin it, that mean I'ma shoot (Bah)
Hop out the Maybach and Prada my boot (Prada)
Thirty mill' plus and I don't wear a suit (Plus)
Bust like a gusher, you play with my group (Bust)
Singin' like Usher, this chopper a fool
Hustler customers, do it for you
This nigga broke, you snooze, you lose (Lose)
Louis V coat pocket filled with blues (Blues)
I'm outta here, five, four, three, two, one (Go)
Takeoff, touch my brother, pull a gun, baow
Five, four, three, two, one (Five, four, three, two, one)
Five, four, three, two, one (Five, four, three, two, one)
Five, four, three, two, one (Five, four, three, two, one)
Five, four, three, two, one (Five, four, three, two, one)
Five, four, three, two, one (Five, four, three, two, one)
Five, four, three, two, one (Five, four, three, two, one)
