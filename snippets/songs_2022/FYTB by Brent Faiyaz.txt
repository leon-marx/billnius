Shawty, it's only you and me
Fuck is you talking 'bout?
Yeah, holla if you hear me
Baby, I see you so much in my dreams
We could've worked it out, fuck is you talking 'bout?
Lately, I been lookin' for love
But I only come up on the drugs, stall me out
So if you ain't the one
Either find me some money or find me a plug
'Cause I'm running out
And that's on me
I'm a hot nigga, check my degrees
NUWO my bitch and my tees
Mark came through with like three
Fabe brought like ten
And Buddha came through with the E
Rolling all night, session at three

Uh, stop it
I can't do no talking
I was just fucked up, nigga got back up
Now these bad bitches keep stalking
Uh, money keep calling
Pussy ass niggas keep stalling, yeah
Nigga just touched down, I just got bust down
Brand new wrist how I'm balling
Fuck a bag up can't call it, yeah
Bitch, ooh it's a Friday
I get my money in five ways, I'm in the driveway
Diamonds on me like Zimbabwe, uh
Bitches love me like Beyonce
All black boy like I'm Chauncey
Nigga just blase blase, bitch, I don't partake
I get that bread, I don't parlay
Ooh bitch, niggas ain't minding they business
I'm rich and they getting offended
Niggas be timid, I'm in your bitch like a dentist (For real)
All my money blue and teal, yeah
I just woke up in the hills, yeah
I was just fucked up, nigga got back up
I can tell you how it feel, yeah
I just woke up popped a seal, yeah
I just woke up signed a deal, bitch
And I'm still in the field, yeah
Fuck them niggas, how they feel, yeah

Shawty, it's only you and me
Fuck is you talking 'bout?
Yeah, holla if you hear me
Baby, I see you so much in my dreams
We could've worked it out, fuck is you talking 'bout?
Lately, I been lookin' for love
But I only come up on the drugs, stall me out
So if you ain't the one
Either find me some money or find me a plug
'Cause I'm running out

And that's on purpose
I'm a cold nigga, watch how I work it
NUWO my bitch and my curtains
Come around here get nervous
Juan threw me a oop
Hamma came through with some 30s
Geeking all night, flying out early2Embed
