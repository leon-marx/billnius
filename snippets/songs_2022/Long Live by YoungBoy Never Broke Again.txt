Long Live Lyrics
Time for demolition, up the gat penetrating
Trap wasn't vacant, broke in places for to get us a payment
He deal that boy, he living hard, she thinkin' that it's amazing
Like he ain't tired, she gotta grind if she wanna amaze him
If you know he ain't gon' die for you
What the fuck you think he gon' give his all for?
Put his whole life on the line and lose it all to you?
Like bitch I had it hard, you think I used to break in cars
Stand on the block just me and Vaughn
Wit' not one rod, servin' hard
Used to think coke or wit' the soda would turn my life over
Ran into a problem, hand on the chopper turned me to a soldier
Think 'bout my mama, feel I'm her best man but didn't get to notice
Hangin' out that window with my left hand, tryna roller coaster
Think I been tryna get put on my whole life for a nigga to take my whole life
Now I roll dice and I know, I gotta keep my soul tight
Chasin' hoes through the day, sleepin' with 'em through the night
Fuck around and get you zipped up, identified on that site
My nigga died from that boy, no, he ain't died from that pipe
Youngin' in Adidas he want rank so by the night he gone need stripes
Live by the gun, youngin' keep a heater aint have it once it cost his life
Fucked up once bitch screamin' even hoe why I got you in my life
Wonder how Meechy feel 'bout Artist
Wonder how this bitch feel knowin' that I keep it too real and won't let me see my daughter
Wonder how that boy feel in this war field took half his whole army
Praying that I'm gone, heal knowing God here
Know you hear my soul alarming
I'm like uhh
Slip up, they gon' take my life
Keep my pistol real tight
They won't take me out tonight
I'm like uhh
But I've been tryna do it right
Fightin' with demons through the night
Behind this flag, he lose his life

Chasin' money, jail time, these niggas dying I had a hard year
Behind that flag, youngin' gotta die or make sure that he gon' kill
South vers' west, through it I will never lie
Ain't no welcome for that boy in here
It ain't no squashin', I'll never end it
I'm screamin' murder, nigga, long live
Put in situations kind of make me hate you, now I'm wrong here
Sent a text, see what you sayin', I read, it say, "I'm all alone here"
Up in jail, you said this, came home, now you never call here
Now she tell her mama, "He got new bitch, and he don't want her around him"
Dirty ass nigga attention's towards you, genuine as pain
Lord know he doing anything for you but you don't feel remorse behind a thing
But this ain't the life of regrets, who am I to sit and judge a thing?
Time to double back, I'ma let you talk behind my back while I watch the game
You might also like
I'm like uhh
Slip up, they gon' take my life
Keep my pistol real tight
They won't take me out tonight
I'm like uhh
But I've been tryna do it right
Fightin' with demons through the night
Behind this flag, he lose his life

I'm like uhh
Slip up, they gon' take my life
Keep my pistol real tight
They won't take me out tonight
I'm like uhh
But I've been tryna do it right
Fightin' with demons through the night
Behind this flag, he lose his life1Embed
