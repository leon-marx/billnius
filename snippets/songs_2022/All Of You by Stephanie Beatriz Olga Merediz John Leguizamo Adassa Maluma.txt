TranslationsTagalog / All Of You Lyrics
Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless, but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift

And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you
Not some gift, just you, the miracle is you
All of you, all of you

Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno!)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay!

Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsettin'
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweatin'
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go!
That's what I'm always saying, bro!
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
Hey! (Uh) We're just happy that you're here, okay? (But)

Come into the light
The triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
(Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (What's that sound?)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (I think it's everyone in town)
(Hey!)
You might also like
Lay down your load (Lay down your load)
We're only down the road (We're only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you

It's a dream when we work as a team (All of you, all of you)
You're so strong, yeah, but sometimes I cry (All of you, all of you)
So do I

I may not be as strong, but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant somethin' new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go!

The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you

 Oh
 Hey, Mariano, why so blue?
 I just have so much love inside
 You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
 Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye!
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry
Every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment
So would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you
And I hear you
Yes!

All of you, all of you (Let's get married! Slow down!)
All of you, all of you

Home sweet home, I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we! That's true!
Just one more thing, before the celebration (What?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you

 We see how bright you burn
 We see how brave you've been
 Now, see yourself in turn
 You're the real gift, kid, let us in
 Open your eyes

Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
