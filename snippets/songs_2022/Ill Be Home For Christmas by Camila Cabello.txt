Ill Be Home For Christmas Lyrics
I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love
Even more than I usually do
And although I know it's a long road back
I promise you

I'll be home for Christmas
You can count on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents under the tree
Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas (I'll be home for Christmas)
You can count on me (You can count on me)
Please have snow (Have snow) and mistletoe (Yeah, yeah)
And prsents under the tree (Undr the tree)

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light gleams
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

If only in my dreams
In my dreams, I'll be
