TranslationsEspanolFreaky Deaky Lyrics
I've been feelin' freaky deaky
You're on your way to see me
Got the mirror on the ceiling
You're in the mood to please me
I've been feelin' freaky deaky
You're on your way to see me
Got the mirror on the ceiling
You're in the mood to please me, yeah

Uh, my lil' shawty always on time (Time)
I pick you up, come outside, take you for a ride (Ride)
Body like December, ass on summertime (Ayy, ayy)
Take off the top (Ooh, ooh), sweet Carolin (Woo)
Meet my jeweler, put ic on that (That)
Ayy, two diamond chains, what's the price on that? (That)
When you worth what you worth, I invest in that (Yeah)
Itty-bitty waist but your ass so fat (Yeah)
Let me slide in it, Wayne Gretzky (Ayy)
Let me see it bounce like a jet ski, ayy (Ayy)
I know you wishing he was like me (Like me)
Late night, callin' me for some good D, ayy
I've been feelin' freaky deaky
You're on your way to see me
Got the mirror on the ceiling
You're in the mood to please me
I've been feelin' freaky deaky
You're on your way to see me
Got the mirror on the ceiling
You're in the mood to please me, yeah

You could break her back and I can put it on rice (Yeah)
I got sleeping issues so I do it all night (Ayy)
Boy, give me a show and put the pussy on ice
Keep your eyes shut, I'ma go tough (I'ma)
He don't want an "If" or an "And," just butt
Don't give me a "Miss" or a "Ma'am," just "Slut"
Boy, just let me switch up on your ass and fuck
