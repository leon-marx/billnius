Half Of Me Lyrics
I'm supposed to mow the grass today
I'm supposed to fix the fence
But with the sun beaten down on me
It's hard to make it make sense

Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, that's the cold hard truth
And with the frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
And the other half does too
Yeah, I kinda need to wash my truck
But hell, I kinda don't care
I think old Alan Jackson said it best
"It's five o'clock somewhre"

Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, that's th cold hard truth
And with the 'frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, the other half does too

Yeah, yeah
Half of me wants a cold beer
If I did what I should be doin' but then that would really ruin all the fun, yeah
There's a world of bad decisions out there, but this ain't one

'Cause half of me wants a cold, cold beer
Yeah, that's the cold hard truth (Yeah, it is)
And with the 'frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me, what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
And the other half does too
You might also like
Yeah, half of me wants a cold, cold beer
The other half wants two

Woo-hoo!
That sounds good, but I can't tell if that's your end or notEmbed
