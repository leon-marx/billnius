What He Didnt Do Lyrics
Everybody's asking what the hell happened
Wondering why it all went wrong
Mama always said if you can't say something nice
Then don't say anything at all
I've got my side of the story and he's got his side, too

And I ain't gonna go and tell you what he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do
Treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
And always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the nd, it wasn't what he did, no
It was what he didn't do

I'm already halfway ovr him and I ain't taking time to turn around
And I'ma take the high road, even though we both know
I could run him out of this town
That's just dirty laundry, I don't need to wear the truth

So I ain't gonna tell you everything he did
But I'll tell you what he didn't do

Treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
And always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he couldn't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did, no
It was what he didn't do
You might also like
I ain't met the right one yet but I know when I do

He'll treat me right, put me first, be a man of his word
Stay home 'cause he wanted to
And always fight for my love, hold on tight like it's something
That he can't stand to lose
The devil's in the details
I won't tell the hell that he put me through
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did, no
It was what he didn't do
All I know is in the end, it wasn't what he did, no
It was what he didn't do3Embed
