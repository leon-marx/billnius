Neighborhood Superstar Lyrics
(Leor, light it up)

She like Baby blue like she from Carolina
Ain't folding under pressure, so I had to buy her diamonds
Ain't talk 'bout shit on waist, but tell 'em, "They don't want my problems now"
We gon' double back, jump out with straps, run down, and pop 'em, slime
Ain't goin' for shit, I do too much, you can ask my mama, I be on everything (Everything)
She be like, "Baby, just chill"
Uh, I be like, "Baby, shit real"
I looked in your eyes, but you looked at the floor, so I'm tryna know what you know, what's the deal? (What's goin' on?)
Yeah, nigga, do we got a problem?
Uppin' on every car that pull beside m
Leavin' they project full of bodis
I turn that beat to plenty homis
Soon as he come out, then we got him, we gon' drop him, bitch
I'm full of pills, I'm sorry, mama
Them niggas slang that fire at my lil' partners
I can't squash it, it's a must, you know I gotta
I been with that shit, they know that
Got Ms, been bleedin' before that
Five K, nigga, check my coat tag
Slip once, leave the bitch with a toe tag
Drive fast, no plate on the Maybach
Trap house where they stash them plates at
Goyard where I tuck my Drac' at
Stick who? Nigga know I don't play that

Let's go
Stay out the way with them cameras
I just seen Baby pull up in the Phantom
Almost hit me, nigga hopped out with a thick bitch (Yeah), must be from Atlanta
Fuck that, they ain't see I hopped out with that blammer
They ain't know I got in with the stick on me
They don't know that this bitch right here bulletproof (Let's go)
I can't wait for a nigga to hit it (Let's go)
I really be cool as a bitch, but get rude as a bitch if I get the wrong energy (Yeah)
They know I'll put a ho out if I love her or not to protect my lil' energy
Maybe, shit, Baby too real for the industry
You might also like
Or maybe they know that they never could get to me
Know that they know that they never could finish me
Let off my glizzy, I'm feelin' a symphony, yeah
I'm in a 'Burban and I got it on me
Three hundred thousand, just me and my homie
Lurkin', we loaded all the way 'til the morning
Get a bad lil' bitch so I could bone her
Nawf 38, posted on that corner
Waitin' for opps and duckin' cops
Thirty on my hip and under papa house I got a hundred shots
Nigga spin on his block, on Dump, don't stop, I could bet his car get chopped
Let me hit from the back, say, "Top"
Come out, turn around, then let her get on top
Got millions, still invest in blocks, we get 'em, never through the mail
The spot be jumpin' like some Shocks, no Jigga, get it on for real
I ain't done, what it is? It get dumb for real
Let 'em talk that shit while on them pills
Turn down as soon he feel this steel
Nigga know we do this shit for real
Try fight by night, his top get peeled
In the car by one, by two, he killed
By four, I booked and flew the jet, on the way LA while on a Lear
She on me bad, so what it is?
Grip her body, know I got it
Take her home and beat her body
I be diggin' all inside it
Suicidal, kamikaze
Pussy shit, I don't acknowledge
Jump out runnin' from them choppers
Tried to hide and then they caught me, gang
I leave a stain, all you hear is, "Bang, bang"
Bitch, lay down, I run that gang
They know I'm the murder man
Don't come around, leave you frowned
Fuck around, it's gon' go down
Equip that shit, it ain't a sound
Left nine bodies in the town
Yeah, I left my bitch and got somethin' new, left her too, bitch, I'm a hound (Rawr, rawr)
Ready to bite me a nigga (I'm a dog)
I really don't like that lil' nigga
Baby, ooh, he an icy lil' nigga (Go)
I'm in this bitch with that stick, poppin' shit, I'ma pull that bitch out 'fore I fight me a nigga (Boom, boom)
I'm on vacation and can't get my hands on a banger, I fuck around, knife me a nigga
I fuck around, poke me a nigga (Uh)
I fuck around, choke me a nigga (Uh, bitch)
I fuck 'round and take me a lil' nigga ho (Yeah), put dick in her face, make her beatbox (Go)
Ain't seen a thing hotter since he popped
Fuck that, four-five, got it on de-cock
On that bullshit you niggas think that you on (Let's go)
Fuck around and get spanked for a song (Get spanked)
Fuck around and get spinned for a diss (Get spinned)
You gon' let that comment get you killed (Yeah, bitch)
Every day, tryna stay out the way, still adjusting to fame in this industry shit (Yeah, nigga)
Send a shh, and I'll pay for the shit
I go in your shit, make you pay for that lip (Keep going)
Neighborhood superstar, throwing weed in the car, they like, "Boy, you can't pay for that zip" (Keep going)
They like, "Nigga, we ain't charging you shit" (Keep going)
Baby put on for Charlotte, he lit (Yeah)
Like, cold blooded killer in the car behind me with a bot and it's stock on the side of his stick (Boom, boom)
Always thinking 'bout a body, can't forget about the last two, he add another homi' on the list
On that day, they got two of them bitches
This one a semi, this one a switch
Doing my dance in here thuggin', yeah, he hating for free, the nigga's a bitch
I'm in here with Nina Simone, I made her top fast, gave her some tits
Pulling her hair, then she stutter, yeah
Fucking on her with no rubber, yeah (Oh, yeah)

She like Baby blue like she from Carolina
Ain't folding under pressure, so I had to buy her diamonds
Ain't talk 'bout shit on waist, but tell 'em, "They don't want my problems now"
We gon' double back, jump out with straps, run down, and pop 'em, slime
Ain't goin' for shit, I do too much, you can ask my mama, I be on everything
She be like, "Baby, just chill"
Uh, I be like, "Baby, shit real"
I looked in your eyes, but you looked at the floor, so I'm tryna know what you know, what's the deal?
Yeah, nigga, do we got a problem?
Uppin' on every car that pull beside me5Embed
