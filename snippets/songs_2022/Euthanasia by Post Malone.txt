TranslationsTurkceEspanolFrancaisEuthanasia Lyrics
Took a fuckin' sip from my ash can
It didn't bother me too much
I spit another tooth in the trash can
I gave up on keepin' me in touch

When I go out, it ain't gonna hurt at all
A choir of angels, euthanasia

Behold, a sober moment
Too short, and far between
I should crack one open
To celebrate bein' clean
When I go out, it ain't gonna hurt at all
An end to anger, euthanasia
When I go out, it ain't gonna hurt at all
Familiar stranger, euthanasia

They say it's painless
