TranslationsEspanolPortuguesLove Language Lyrics
Said patience ain't no virtue with you
I done wasted plenty time pacin' around, hate this coupe
You had bitches on the side, I let my mind wonder too
You relentless, nigga, I don't need rent, nigga
Text me like I'm waiting for you to come lie to me
Ruin my day sayin' shit to hurt me, I can't compete
Still on the way, I lay awake if you're not around me
I'm so on to you, still gone for you

Needin' you to talk to me in your love language
Show me, yeah, how to connect to you
Help me understand how you speak your love language
Bad as I wanna be yours, I can't get with your program
Sex hittin' like a slow jam, stick around 'cause I want to
Bad as I wanna keep focused
You remind me I'm imperfect and it sucks to admit
Nobody put that purpose in me like you do, still
Nobody get that work up out me like you do
Nobody get the truth up out me quite like you
You the definition of my right hand
Never mind ridin' backseat when you lead me

Talk to me in your love language
Show me, yeah, how to connect to you
Help me understand how you speak your love language

Call me like you can't suppress memories of me
Call me like you got confessions queued up
Like your last bitch, lookin' chewed up, baby
Call me like you don't regret missin' this old thing back, call me
When you know the difference between me and chickens

You don't wanna be, be without me
You don't wanna live
I don't wanna go, ooh, no
I don't wanna be alone, oh
All that I know is mirrors inside me
They recognize you, please don't deny meYou might also like2Embed
