GIVE HEAVEN SOME HELL Lyrics
Can't believe that you got me in a suit and tie
I had to take a pull so I wouldn't cry
You got a line out the church door sayin' goodbye
Yeah, I believe 'em when they say you're in a better place
You had a wild side, but you had amazing grace
I know you're way off up in them clouds
But if you can still hear me right now

I hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
I hope your mansion in the sky's got a ten-acre field
With some mud and some hubs you can lock in
Make some thunder, make 'em wonder how you got in
Hide your beer, hide your clear from the man upstairs
Crank it loud, hold it down 'til I get there
And when I do, I hope you got some new stories to tell
'Til then, give Heaven some hell
I bet you're lookin' for a crew like we had
Bunch of noise-makin' boys that like to live fast
Burnin' rubber in a parkin' lot
Man, I don't know if the other side's ready or not, but

I hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
I hope your mansion in the sky's got a ten-acre field
With some mud and some hubs you can lock in
Make some thunder, make 'em wonder how you got in
Hide your beer, hide your clear from the man upstairs
Crank it loud, hold it down 'til I get there
And when I do, I hope you got some new stories to tell
'Til then, give Heaven some hell

I was there when you raised your hand
Heads bowed, singing just as I am
Walkin' that aisle, prayin' that prayer
Man, it ain't right, but if you gotta be there

I hope you hit those gold streets on two wheels
Hope your mansion in the sky's got a ten-acre field
With some mud and some hubs you can lock in
Make some thunder, make 'em wonder how you got in
Hide your beer, hide your clear from the man upstairs
Crank it loud, hold it down 'til I get there
And when I do, I hope you got some new stories to tell
'Til then, give Heaven some hell
You might also like
I was there when you raised your hand
Heads bowed, singing just as I am
Man, it ain't right, man, it ain't fair
I'll see you again
But 'til then, give Heaven some hell2Embed
