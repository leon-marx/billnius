Sweet Little Lies Lyrics
Yeah, mm (Tahj Money)
Yeah
Wrote it in her diary a thousand times
Youngin'
Yeah
Uh, yeah
Look, yeah, look, uh

Tell me that you love me, look me deep in my eyes (Yeah)
Tell me that you need me and, for me, you will ride
Write it in your diary a thousand times
Practice your lines, 'cause I love to hear your sweet little lies
(Yeah)
I live to hear your sweet little lies (Yeah)
Your sweet little lies (Yeah)
Sweet little lies
Sweet little lies, sweet little lies, yeah
They say I'm crazy, I'm bipolar, I need some damn help
Why say forever if we gon' die by our damn self?
She said she love, don't mean that her feelings was strong
But after every funeral, life must go on, that's how it go
Penthouse, top floor, high as ever could be
You would think that they would've been came to check up on me
Call the front desk and tell 'em that I need my room cleaned
Housekeeper came in and threw away all my lean
I guess I ain't sleepin' tonight, yeah
That shit there three thousand a pint
My bad attitude keep me in this world alone
In the back of my mind, I know

Tell me that you love me, look me deep in my eyes (Yeah)
Tell me that you need me and, for me, you will ride
Write it in your diary a thousand times
Practice your lines, 'cause I love to hear your sweet little lies
I live to hear your sweet little lies (Yeah)
Your sweet little lies (Yeah)
Sweet little lies
Sweet little lies, sweet little lies, yeahYou might also like1Embed
