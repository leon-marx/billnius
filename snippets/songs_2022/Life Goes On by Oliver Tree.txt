TranslationsEspanolLife Goes On Lyrics
Babe, you're too controlling
Ima feed you to the wolves
When you get nasty, back at me
But, baby, don't distract me
I'm a goner, I lost her
Like why the hell you wanna
Play me that way? Youre bad, babe
You double-faced entendre

Life goes on and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on
Babe, you best believe it
I'ma rip you up to pieces
I'm a lover, not a fighter
But I'll light this place on fire
I want it, I'm on it
But, babe, at least I'm honest
I get tired of explaining
As these seasons keep on changing

Life goes on and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
On and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Work all day and then I wake up
Work all day and then I wake up
Work all day and then I wake up
Work all day (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Work all day and then I wake up
Work all day and then I wake up
Work all day and then I wake up
Work all day
