Ah (Pressure)
Mmm (Pressure)
Ooh (Pressure)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Y'all know what this is

Keep your eyes on me, eyes on me, apply that (Pressure)
Get it, don't be timid when you in it, apply that (Pressure)
Love up on it, nibble on it, leave it (Pressure)
I don't want no drip, baby, spray it like you mean it
So fine and spicy, baby, jump up on this (Pressure)
I guess that's why you like it, baby, come and get this (Pressure)
Takes a lot to excite me, baby, give it all you got (Pressure)
I'm a tough cookie, baby, hit the right spot
Now you textin' me, you know I won't reply (Reply)
Why you ain't fuck with me when I wasn't this fly? (Fly)
Now I'm on top and now I'm ridin' sky-high (Pressure)
Don't need nobody, but I'll take you down tonight
And I'm okay with bein' nasty (Pressure)
Too fuckin' hot for all these clothes anyway (Pressure)
My body drippin', boy, but you gon' have to wait (Pressure)
But when you get it, lick it like a candy cane

Keep your eyes on me, eyes on me, apply (Pressure)
Get it, don't be timid when you in it, apply (Pressure)
Love up on it, nibble on it, leave it (Pressure)
Said I don't want no drip, baby, spray it like you mean it
So fine and spicy, baby, jump up on this (Pressure)
I guess that's why you like it, baby, come and get this (Pressure)
Takes a lot to excite me, baby, give it all you got (Pressure)
I'm a tough cookie, baby, hit the right spot

So bop it, baby, twist it, honey
Do it like you mean it, darling
Keep it comin', ooh (Pressure)
Keep me runnin', leave it messy (Pressure)
Go ahead and live in it, swim up in me, oh
So bop it, baby, twist it, honey (Hey)
Do it like you mean it, darling (Hey)
Keep it comin', ooh (Pressure)
Keep me runnin' (Hey), leave it messy (Pressure)
Go ahead and live in it, swim up in me, oh
