Who Want Smoke? Lyrics
I'm wicked
I'm wicked
I'm wicked (Emkay)
I'm wicked

Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me? I'm tryna fuck a nigga lungs up
They be like, "Nardo, put them damn guns up"
Fuck that, say, "Big brother, bring them guns out"
When it's smoke, we get to spinnin' while the sun out
I ain't never lackin', I pump gas with my gun out
Scream out, "What's happenin'?" then get to bussin' 'til it run out
All these niggas hidin', I'm lik where they at? It ain't no fun now
7.62s big as hll'll knock a nigga lungs out
One, two, three, four (Kick your door, get on the floor)
Five, six, seven, eight (Don't make no noise, I'll eat your face)
Nine, ten, eleven, we ain't gon' say that number, we don't fuck with jakes
I'ma kill fourteen niggas if thirteen bitch niggas play
I think my Draco might be gay (Why?), 'cause he blow niggas
I just got a brand new Lolli, that's a four-nickel
Call me Nardo yes-man, I don't know niggas
You can send your best man, you gon' lose your best hitter

What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
That's how I step on niggas
(How I step on these bitch-ass niggas, yeah)

We step on shit like Craig daddy
We in the gym, no pep rally
Won't come outside, he scared probably
They deeper than a fuckin' party
That don't matter (Why?)
'Cause I'm gon' spray this bitch at everybody
I'm Nardo, bitch, I do magic
Turn his whip into a basket
Take his life, he shouldn't have had it
I'm quick to snap just like my daddy
My nina rules, she kinda sassy
Let her go, she'll let you have it
Play you, lay you, try you down
I'm cold as hell, but I let off fire
Please don't try 'cause you gon' die
And I don't wanna see your mama cry

Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Who want smoke with me?
Nigga, who want smoke with me?

What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?
That's how I step on niggas
(How I step on these bitch-ass niggas, yeah)7Embed
