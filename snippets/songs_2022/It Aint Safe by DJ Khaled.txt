TranslationsDJ Khaled - IT AINT SAFE ft. Kodak Black & Nardo Wick (Traduccion al Espanol)IT AINT SAFE Lyrics
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up)
The emergency brakes broke (We the best music)
And ain't no stoppin' this shit either though
Ain't no such things as red lights, I don't even know where to go (Another one, DJ Khaled)

I don't got no brakes, it ain't no stoppin' this
I'm the youngest nigga poppin' shit
They wanna stop the fire, but it's too late, this shit got super lit
She see the way I pull a bitch
You see the way these diamonds hit
Nigga try to touch my chain, you gon' see the way this .40 kick
They don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)
They don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't saf)
They don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't saf)
You don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)

Why it just got hot in here? Oh, look Wick just walked in here
I don't be with fuck niggas, but I keep my FN
Bro go move the double R, we got somebody blocked in
Just saw my partner from Atlanta, he said "You fresh as fuck, twin"
Swing that stick like Jackie Robinson and we slide home
He so innocent in real life, but gangster on the phone
Funny how she say that I'm the dog, but ate me off the bone
I heard her nigga mad, she came home smelling like my cologne
All I know is go, it ain't no stoppin', ain't no slowin' down
I don't want that nigga around me if he ain't gon' pow-pow
I don't want that necklace if that Cuban link don't bling-baow
I don't want that pretty girl if she don't know how to work her mouth
We look like some old people, everybody got a stick
Know my phone ain't never dead, but I pull up five percent
When I walk, my chains go back and forth like they in an argument
If he stare at this car too long, "Grrah, grrah" through the tint

They don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)
They don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)
They don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)
You don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)

I'm in the cut, uh, scissor, I'm a cutthroat lil' nigga
I been fucking her since December, now her butt been gettin' bigger
Nobody ain't told me I was trippin' when I picked up the pistol
Started off with good intentions, how the fuck I turned to a killer?
Cutthroat motherfucker, I go straight for the jugular
I'ma cut through with that cutter, doo-doo-doo-doo, did I stutter?
I'm sleepin' on this side of the bed tonight, bitch, don't touch me
Finna breeze through every nigga block I don't fuck with
Ain't none of my homeboys got stepped on 'cause we do the stompin'
Don't fuck with niggas from the ugly corner, this shit gon' get ugly
We ain't have shit in the projects, so I made it regardless
And I never ain't have a problem I couldn't solve with my chopper (This shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe)

They don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)
They don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)
They don't want no problems with us ('Cause it ain't safe)
You don't want no problems with us (That shit ain't safe)

This shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe ('Cause it ain't safe)
This shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe (That shit ain't safe)
This shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe ('Cause it ain't safe)
This shit ain't safe, this shit ain't safe (That shit ain't safe)1Embed
