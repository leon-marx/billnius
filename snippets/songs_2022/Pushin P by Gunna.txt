Pushin' P
Yeah, pushin' P, turn me up
Turn me up, P, uh-ah

Pointers in the Patek and my piece, I'm pushin' P
Copped new hammers for my P, we don't want no peace
Got a spot across the spot, just for P's
Dropped the dot and then we plot, exotic P's
She not a lesbian, for P, she turn Pesbian (Pushin' P, I'm pushin' P)
Off capital P, I rock these presidents, count presidents (Pushin' P)
Portuguese on her knees, moppin' down the P
She let me squeeze, then she lave 'cause she keep it P
