Bring It On Lyrics
(Any last words?)
(D-Roc)

I see a new hat, nigga with a blue flag
Big Mac, catch 'em, let it go, nigga, fetch that
Bitch nigga, fuck nigga
Catch 'em, we gon' knock his ass
All these niggas hoes
And they know I be on they ass (Uh)
Nigga say they want me, I be on it
I see a new hat, nigga with a blue flag
Big Mac, nigga know I let go that, buss his ass (Let's go)
That's my gang bro, mama, he ain't make it home
Plenty killings in the fuckin' city
I'm out of action, I ain't been up in it
Said the whole town with that murder business
Said them young niggas wit' them 30s sittin'
Waitin', for to pull another killin'
Rap niggas catch this whole semi
Fuck 'round, leave his soul different
Don't bring me in no mentions
Got this thirty on me, nigga (Yeah)
Find out whre they home, thy gon' all get it
I been tryna raise my children, ain't whack something in a lil' minute
These niggas, they know I'm wit' it
Know they don't want drag me in it
It's gon' be some bullets flyin' and mamas cryin' inside the city
They know this murder shit, I came in with and leave out with it
They know I'm bloody and got more bodies then they whole committee
Ever since a toddler, been a problem, they can't fuckin' get me
Lil' bro gon' pop out wit' it

Ring around the rosie
Pussy tryna dome me
Know the police on me
They know that they can't clone me
Shawty say she want me
Know that I got money
Say that they don't like me
'Cause I'm always stuntin' (Yeah)
You might also like
Know for a fact soon as he lack that I'm gon' stretch him
This ain't no Hellcat, nigga, this a catch-him
Let him talk that shit, they must don't want him
Draco gon' neglect him
Left him baptized right there on that corner
They know who the fuck blessed him

Tell 'em bring it on, let's get it (Oh)
Mama, I got demons inside my body
All these niggas gon' get it, they knowin' how I'm rockin'
I tell 'em bring it on, let's get it (Oh-oh, oh, oh)
Mama, I got demons inside my body
They know that I been chillin', they tryna bring me out it
Let's collect they body

On the phone with my brother, he lurkin'
We catch 'em, we do 'em dirty, we be leavin' 'em now
In the car while them niggas be swervin'
They pullin' on side, nobody left breathin' in there
On my knees, on side of the bed, I'm prayin' with beads
I know they receivin' 'em now
I'm like, "God, I'm tryin', so please, them niggas be trippin', they steady be bringin' me there"
I don't give a fuck if kids in there
I just wanna see his braincells
Tryna knock his fuckin' brains out, brains out
He stunt for Insta', at your funeral, I just tell your mama invite 'em all
It's gon' be a fuckin' bang-out, bang-out
I see a new hat, nigga with a blue flag
Big Mac, catch 'em, let it go, nigga, fetch that
Bitch nigga, fuck nigga
Catch 'em, we gon' knock his ass
All these niggas hoes
And they know I be on they ass

Tell 'em bring it on, let's get it (Oh-oh, oh)
Mama, I got demons inside my body
All these niggas gon' get it, they knowin' how I'm rockin'
I tell 'em bring it on, let's get it (Oh-oh, oh, oh)
Mama, I got demons inside my body
They know that I been chill, and they tryna bring me out it
Let's collect they body

It's YoungBoy
Ayy, bitch ass nigga, say
If you ain't Quando, say
Don't bring no blue flag around me
If you ain't somebody that he love
Bitch ass nigga, don't call me cuz, you already know what it is
We gon' tie your pussy ass up
And that's off the flap, nigga
Tell these niggas bring it on, they some motherfuckin' cheerleaders
You heard me?
And I'm still ridin' wit' that 45, and it's still illegal
Tell them niggas get at me, slime
You heard me?
You already know how I'm rockin'
You already know how I get it poppin'
Bitch ass nigga, we dyin' behind this green flag
You heard me? You better keep your rocket
It's Northside, 38, 4KT, FreeDDawg
Who gon' die today?
I see a new hat, nigga with a blue flag
Big Mac, catch 'em, let it go, nigga, fetch that
Bitch nigga, fuck nigga
Catch 'em, we gon' knock his ass
All these niggas hoes
And they know I be on they ass1Embed
