Wishful Drinking Lyrics
Maybe I'm just wishful drinking
Give my heart something to sink in
Better make it two, nothing I won't do
For another round of me and you

I know it's a shot in the dark
Looking for what's left of a spark
Throwing 'em back like I got nothing to lose
It's a slow burn just like you
Everybody says, "Give it time"
But I'm feeling like I'm stuck on rewind
Throwing 'em back like I got nothing to lose
It's a slow burn just like you
When I'm a couple in, I get optimistic
Like you and me are realistic

Maybe I'm just wishful drinking
Give my heart something to sink in
Better make it two, nothing I won't do
For another round of me and you
I get hopeful whn I'm tipsy
Thinking you might actually miss me
It's a hundred proof, nothing I won't do
For another round of m and you
I'm wishful drinking

Ooh, ooh, ooh

With every sip I'm getting closer
To thinking that we ain't really over
I know it ain't right but, baby, just for tonight
I don't wanna have no closure

When I'm a couple in, I get optimistic
Like you and me are realistic
You might also like
Maybe I'm just wishful drinking
Give my heart something to sink in
Better make it two, nothing I won't do
For another round of me and you
I get hopeful when I'm tipsy
Thinking you might actually miss me
It's a hundred proof, nothing I won't do
For another round of me and you
I'm wishful drinking

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, I'm wishful drinking
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Wishful drinking, wishful drinking, wishful drink'

I'm tracing your footprints through my memories
Trying to find where we went wrong
Replacing the space you left with new things
Nothing I try lasts long

Maybe I'm just wishful drinking
Give my heart something to sink in
Better make it two, nothing I won't do
For another round of me and you (Another round of me and you)
I get hopeful when I'm tipsy
Thinking you might actually miss me
It's a hundred proof, nothing I won't do
For another round of me and you (You)
I'm wishful drinking
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah, I'm wishful drinking)
I'm wishful drinking
Ooh, ooh, ooh1Embed
