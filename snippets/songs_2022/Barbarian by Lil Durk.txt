TranslationsEspanolBarbarian Lyrics
(Dmac on the fuckin' track)
(Ayy, pull up, Lam)
(Ayo, Pluto, you goin' brazy)

I showed a lot of niggas love, and I'd give 'em my last
Why you tell that bitch my business? Know she bring up my past
But I ain't even run my mouth, what you would do for the cash
You walk around like I'm a goofy, like I won't put you on blast
And I heard you told your friends, you ain't get the chance to finesse
These niggas claim they witnessed murders until they see one stretched
I'm tryna go to war with murder, I ain't tryna war with success
And we on 59th for murder, he put that shit on his back
Man, I be hangin' with them killers, they like Warzone
Woke up with my arm swole, I'm sleepin' with my watch on
Booster bitches bring me all type of shit without the barcode
I wasn't watchin' Dexter's Laboratory, I was watchin' Narcos
Late night ridin' in the trenches, duckin' potholes
I done watched my homie run up M's off gelato
Bro ain't into drugs, he made a living out of Costco
Should've seen my face, I seen a Glock like fully auto, switch, nigga
Bitch niggas always 'round some rich niggas
Actin' like your ass be rich, you ain't got shit, nigga
Postin' on the 'Gram, you just around 'em 'cause they lit, nigga
You be tryna be in a niggas' section before they bitch, nigga
Instagram bitches ridin' waves, they eatin' dicks, nigga
And you ever lose a nigga you love? That shit hit different
Ever fuck a bitch inside her ass? It make her sit different
I done fell in love with a barber, she legit with it, uh-uh

And that cash is comin' in
Don't be talkin' 'bout your stash 'cause they runnin' in
And that gas is comin' in
Bro just came back off a trip, he got a hundred in
And bro just got another ten
I can imagine how many bodies when the summer end
I can imagine when the summer end
I can imagine when the summer end
You false flaggin', you be throwin' up any gang you see
Became a killer, he became police (Yeah, a killer, he became police)
The trenches say I'm so barbarian
Them drugs got me out of character
My bitches tell me I'm so arrogant
Like fuck them niggas, we ain't letting up
You might also like
Bitch niggas always 'round some rich niggas
Actin' like your ass be rich, you ain't got shit, nigga
Postin' on the 'Gram, you just around 'em 'cause they lit, nigga
You be tryna be in a niggas' section before they bitch, nigga
Instagram bitches ridin' waves, they eatin' dicks, nigga
And you ever lose a nigga you love? That shit hit different
Ever fuck a bitch inside her ass? It make her sit different
I done fell in love with a barber, she legit with it, uh-uh4Embed
