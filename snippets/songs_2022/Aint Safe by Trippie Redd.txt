Aint Safe Lyrics
Nigga, this shit ain't
Nigga, this shit ain't

Nigga, this shit ain't safe
Nigga, this shit ain't safe
I done moved around, Nat Geo
I can dodge that bitch like Neo, huh
Nigga, this shit ain't safe
And her friend came down from Rio
She done moved in with a whole kilo, huh
Keep it poppin', uh, OxyContin, uh
She be poppin', uh, .40's droppin', uh
See me stoppin', uh, never stoppin', uh
OxyContin, uh, .40 drops, uh

Yeah (Yeah, uh)
Nigga, this shit ain't safe
Cartier ice, the face
Pourin' the four in the drank (Yeah, yeah, woo)
Movin' around in a tank
Diamonds, they water, they wet like a lake (Diamonds, they water, they wet lik a lake)
Thinkin' 'bout causin' a scene today (Yah)
Slidin' around with that bank (Yeah)
Slidin' around with a K (Yeah)
You play with my brothers, then you gotta pay
We zip that boy up like he rockin' some BAPE (BAPE)
Pussy, you better obey (Obey)
You niggas better play safe (Play safe, nigga, this shit ain't)
Woah (Nigga, this shit ain't)
You better play safe

Nigga, this shit ain't safe
Nigga, this shit ain't safe
I done moved around, Nat Geo
I can dodge that bitch like Neo, huh
Nigga, this shit ain't safe
And her friend came down from Rio
She done moved in with a whole kilo, huh
You might also like
Keep it poppin', uh, OxyContin, uh
She be poppin', uh, .40's droppin', uh
See me stoppin', uh, never stoppin', uh
OxyContin, uh (Yeah), .40 drops, uh

You know this like risky (Yeah)
Try me, bitch, I'll spray 'til it's empty (Grr, baow)
Purple in my cup, I feel like Pimp C (Swear)
Keep some niggas 'round me down to fall and catch a case (Catch a case)
Bring your crew
We off '42, bae, let's have some sex (Sex)
Bae, let's blow some cheques (Cheques)
Got me gettin' high off them Percocets (Perky)
I can hear the blueface callin'
Yeah, I'm full of that juice (Dirty)
If you run up, I'm sorry, I tried to told you (Baow)

Nigga, this shit ain't safe
Nigga, this shit ain't safe
I done moved around, Nat Geo
I can dodge that bitch like Neo, huh
Nigga, this shit ain't safe
And her friend came down from Rio
She done moved in with a whole kilo, huh
Keep it poppin', uh, OxyContin, uh
She be poppin', uh, .40's droppin', uh
See me stoppin', uh, never stoppin', uh
OxyContin, uh, .40 drops, uh (Uh, uh)4Embed
