Weird Science Lyrics
From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions?
(Weird, ooh!)

(Weird science)
Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces and
The magic from my hand
We're makin'
(Weird science, ooh!)
Things I've never seen before
Behind bolted doors
Talent and imagination
(Weird science)
Not what teacher said to do
Makin' dreams come true
Living tissue; warm flesh
(Weird science, ooh!)
Plastic tubes and pots and pans
Bits and pieces and
Bits and pieces...

(Bits of) My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, ooh, my creation
It's my creation!

(Weird science)
(Weird)
(Ooh!)

(Weird science, ooh!)
Magic and technology
Voodoo dolls and chants
Electricity, we're makin'
(Weird science)
Fantasy and microchips
Shootin' from the hip
Something different, we're makin'
(Weird science, ooh!)
Pictures from a magazine
Diagrams and charts
Mending broken hearts (and makin'
Weird science)
Something like a recipe
Bits and pieces and....
Bits and pieces and...

(Bits of) My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, I do not know
No hesitation, no heart of gold
Just flesh and blood, I do not know
I do not know!
From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions?

(Ooh, weird science)
Magic and technology
Voodoo dolls and chants
(Weird science)
Things I've never seen before
Behind bolted doors
(Weird science)
Not what teachers said to do
Bits and pieces and...
Bits and pieces and...

(Bits of) My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, I do not know
No hesitation, no heart of gold
Just flesh and blood, I do not know
It's my creation
It's my creation (Ooh!)
My creation (Ooh!)
My creation, It's my creation!
From my heart and from my hand
Why don't people understand
My intentions?
(Ooh, weird!)

Ooh, weird science (Ooh!)
(Weird!)
Weird science
Weird science (Ooh!)
Ooh, woah, woah, woah
(Bits and pieces, bits and pieces, bits and pieces)
Ooh, weird science
("She's alive!")
(Bits and pieces and...)
Weird
Ooh, woah, woah, woah
Ooh, weird science
Science
(Bits and pieces and bits and pieces and)
(Bits and) Science
Weird
Weird science
(Bits and pieces)

(Bits of) My creation, is it real?
It's my creation, I do not know
(Ooh!) My creation, is it real?
Just flesh and blood, just flesh and blood
Just flesh and blood!

Weird science, weird science
