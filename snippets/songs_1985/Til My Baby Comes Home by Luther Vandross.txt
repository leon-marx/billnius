Til My Baby Comes Home Lyrics
Look, check it out
There's a whole lot of girls
Messin' around, trying to get me
They do things 'cause they know
My girl is away, they try to upset me
They can't believe I resist
How can I hold out? Where is that girl now?
But the truth really is
I don't worry 'cause I love my baby so...

No matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up 'til I get enough
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home
If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

Listen
I get weak in the knees
My hands start to shakin', head gets to achin'
Is she thinking of me
Or feeling the fire with some other guy, yeah
I can't believe I can be
Worried about her, I shouldn't doubt her
'Cause our thing is for real
And I don't worry 'cause I know, I know, I know...

No matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up 'til I get enough
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home
If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

Bring it on home to me
She makes everything alright
She's good to me
She's the best part of my life
Hey, can't you tell
That I'm just like a new guy
Hey, I'm doing very well
'Cause I know she's coming back tonight
Ooh, I can't wait, can't wait, can't wait, no
I can't wait, can't wait, no
Hey, look, now...
Every night when I sleep
I dream of my baby, she's such a lady
Then I wake up and see
That she's laying by me, right there beside me
I can't explain how I feel
I really love her, keep dreaming of her
'Cause our love is for real
And I don't worry 'cause I know, I know, I know...

No matter where my baby is
She never leaves me without love
She gives it up 'til I get enough
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home
If she stays away for long
She calls me on the phone
I jump up when I hear her voice
Then I'm alright
'Til my baby comes home

Alright, 'til my baby ('til my baby)
'Til my baby ('til my baby) 'til my baby
(Then I'm alright 'til my baby comes home)
'Til my buh-buh-buh-buh-baby
(My buh-buh-buh-buh-baby) Alright
My buh-buh-buh-buh-baby comes home
(Then I'm alright 'til my baby comes home)
Yeah, 'til my buh-buh-buh-buh-baby
(My buh-buh-buh-buh-baby)
My buh-buh-buh-buh, buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-baby
(Then I'm alright 'til my baby comes home)
Hey, 'til my baby, 'til my baby, 'til my baby
Then I'm alright 'til my baby comes homeEmbed
