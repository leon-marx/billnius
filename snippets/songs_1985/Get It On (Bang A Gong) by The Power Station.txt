Get It On (Bang a Gong) Lyrics
Get on


Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Dah!

Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh yeah
Well you're an untamed youth
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl
You might also like
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Ooooh, yeah

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Well you're windy and wild
You've got the blues in your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah
Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're dirty, sweet and you're my girl

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on

Get it on
Bang a gong

Ooooh, yeah

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Ooooh

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on (Bang a gong)
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on

Get it onEmbed
