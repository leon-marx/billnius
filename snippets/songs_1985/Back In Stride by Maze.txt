Back in Stride Lyrics
Tell 'em 'bout it, tell 'em 'bout it, tell 'em 'bout it, tell 'em

There's so much going on, it's crazy, trouble all around
I'll tell you something, I'm not gonna let it get me down
I been going through some funky changes, changes all the same
We like the joy but we can't really stand the pain

I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
I'm so happy to see you and me
Back in stride again

I'm gonna try to keep it coming, things ain't always smooth, oh no
But I'll be alright as long as I can feel the groove
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh) Ooh wee (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Somehow I know that I can make it, you seem to like my style, alright
Well, don't you worry, I'm gonna be around a while
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh) Oh baby (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
I'm just happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
You might also like
Tell you what I'm gonna do
I just wanna be with you
Gonna give it all I can
Yes, I'm back in stride again

There's so much going on, it's crazy, it's trouble all around
Well, I'll tell you something, I'm not gonna let it get me down
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh) No no (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
I been going through some funky changes, changes all the same, ah yeah
We like the joy but we can't really stand the pain
(Ooh ooh, ooh ooh) No no, no no, no no (Ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

Happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
Happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
Happy to see you and me
Back in stride again
Happy to see you and me
(Come on y'all, come on y'all, come on y'all)
Back in stride again
(Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it)
Back in stride again
Back in stride again
Tell you what I'm gonna do
(I'm telling you, I'm telling you)
I just want to be with you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Gonna give it all I can
I'll be back in stride again

Back in stride again
Back in stride again
(Here we go, y'all)
Back in stride again
Back in stride again
Back in stride againEmbed
