The Screams of Passion Lyrics
Whoa no, whoa yeah (Woo, oh)
Whoa no, whoa no, yeah yeah, yeah yeah

There's a gentle autumn breeze that blows
Whenever we be lyin', lyin' in my bed
The moon appears and disappears, you look at me
My clothes I quickly, I quickly shed
The curtains dance a minuet, autumn plays the music, baby
Come on, hold my hand
Leaves are fallin' velvet splash
Only you and I can under-- only you can understand

The sunlight draws a picture through the silky lace
That hangs above your, hangs above your door
A picture that is waving, that it seems to be with every thrust you
Make me beg for more
Oh, a robin sings a masterpiece
That lives and dies unheard
For screams of passion
A sound produced by two in love
Curtains dance and autumn plays on
(Oh, two in love, on and on)
The screams of passion
You might also like
All I hear in my head echoing like a volcano, baby
The screams of passion
Back and forth the raging seas of lust, I want you madly
Can't you tell, can't you tell, can't you tell, can't you tell?
Oww!
Take me in your arms, oh baby
The crime is done, I'd rather die here in your
Screams of passion
Whoa, hold me now, baby
Tell me that you love me
(Is it Sunday)
Or is it passion?

Love, love (The screams of passion)
The screams of passion, yeah yeah, love
The screams of, the screams of, the screams of passion, passion
Hand me that love

Yeah! (Shhh... not so loud baby)
Yeah! (Shhh, shhh)

The screams of passion
The screams of passion
Oh, oh, oh, the screams of passion
Ooh, the screams of, the screams of, the screams of passion
The screams of passion
Back and forth the raging seas of lust
Raging, raging (The screams of passion)
You know I want you madly baby
Why can't you tell? Oww
Is it Sunday? (Ooh love, ooh love)
I thought I heard a church bell (Or was it passion, passion?)
Yeah yeah (Oooh)
Passion
The screams of passion
What did you say baby?
Excuse me, but ...
Is that your passion?
Do you want my passion?
Uh, do you want my passion?

If you want my love, if you want my body baby
Let me hear ya, let me hear ya, let, uh, let me hear ya scream!
I want some passion
Ooooh
You know what I'm talkin' about baby?
Ooooh
I want some passion
You got that baby?
I want some passion
Passion, mmmEmbed
