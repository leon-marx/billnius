Walking on the Chinese Wall LyricsWalking on a Chinese
Walking on a Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to
Watching for the coins to fall
Butterfly, spread
Your painted wings
For an answer
From the Ching
By the stream
Stretching in the rocks
Tiger on the mountaintop
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
Now the sun is rising in the east
Looking for my golden fleece
Ivory skin, scarlet color deep
Lips that burn but do not speak
Three misty nights
Waiting by the shore
May be that my lover
Comes no more
You might also likeRed chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love
On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
Blue red silk burning on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest
Stepping stones on the yellow sea
Dreaming she'll be there for me
Come down the clouds
To the sea of flames
From the mountain
Hear the cry of pain
Red chamber dream
From the sky above
Ancient tales of hidden
Chinese love
On the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall
On the Chinese Wall, oh, yeah
Watching for the coins to fall
(On the Chinese Wall)
Butterfly, spread your wings
From an answer from the Ching
(Watching for the coins to fall)
Blue red silk on my chest
Go to sleep but not to rest, oh, no
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Walking on the Chinese Wall
Watching for the coins to fall.......Embed
