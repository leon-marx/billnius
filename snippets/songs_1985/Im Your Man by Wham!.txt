Im Your Man Lyrics
Call me good
Call me bad
Call me anything you want to, baby
But I know that youre sad
And I know Ill make you happy
With the one thing that you never had

Baby, Im your man
Dont you know that?
Baby, Im your man
You bet!

If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me!
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me!
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me!
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me!

So good, youre divine
Wanna take you, wanna make you
But they tell me its a crime!
Everybody knows where the good people go
But where were going baby
Aint no such word as no!
You might also like
Baby, Im your man
Dont you know who I am?
Baby, Im your man
You bet!

If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me (Come on baby)
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me (Ooh, take me home)
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me (Please dont leave me here)
If youre gonna do it, do it right
To do it on my own

First class information
Sense your inspiration
And with some stimulation
We can do it right

So why waste time with the other guys
When you can have mine?
I aint askin for no sacrifice
Baby, your friends do not need to know!
Ive got a real nice place to go
Listen
I dont need you to care
I dont need you to understand, yeah
All I want is for you to be there
And when Im turned on, if you want me
Im your man! (Im your man)
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me

Now listen
If youre gonna do it, you know what I say?
If youre gonna do it dont throw it away
Dont throw it baby
(Don't throw it, dont throw it)
Because
Ill be your boy, Ill be your man
Ill be the one who understands
Ill be your first, Ill be your last
Ill be the only one you ask
Ill be your friend, Ill be your toy
Ill be the one who brings you joy
Ill be your hope, Ill be your pearl
Ill take you halfway round the world!
Ill make you rich, Ill make you poor
Just dont use the door
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me
If youre gonna do it, do it right (right)
Do it with me1Embed
