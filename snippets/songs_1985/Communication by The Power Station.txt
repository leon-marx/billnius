Communication Lyrics
Airmail, cassettes, postcards, telex
Drop me a line, be my grapevine
I'm always trying to reach you, can't get through
Our communication depends on me and you
Got to stay in touch even though we're on the move
Keep your lines open, say, what's new
Exchange the facts, keep in contact
I keep on trying to call you but I can't get through
Our communication must get through

(Communication) Don't hang up
(Communication) Keep in touch
(Communication) Don't put me on hold
(Situation) Soul to soul

Send word, stay tuned, call me real soon
Every time I phone you, you're not home
We've got to stay in touch on the telephone
I keep on trying to reach you
But I can't get through
Our communication must get through

(Communication) Baby, talk to me
(Communication) Information, please
(Communication) Don't put me on hold
(Situation) Soul to soul
You might also like

(Communication) Don't hang up
(Communication) Keep in touch
(Communication) Don't put me on hold
(Situation) Soul to soul

(Communication) Baby, talk to me
(Communication) Information, please
(Communication) Don't put me on hold
(Situation) Soul to soul

(Communication) Baby, don't hang up
(Communication) Keep in touch
(Communication) Don't put me on hold
(Situation) Soul to soul

(Communication) Baby, talk to me
(Communication) Information, please
(Communication) Don't put me on hold
(Situation) Soul to soul
(Communication) Ah, don't hang upEmbed
