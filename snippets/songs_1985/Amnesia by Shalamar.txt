Amnesia Lyrics
Is this a dream or could it be that I'm just imagining
Is there some chance
For our romance to become reality
Did I hear you say there was a chance for our love
A chance for us to play the game
Oh, to play the game
All night long I tried to remember
Was it something that you said
Did you say that to me, baby

Just one touch from you (One touch from you)
Little girl, I come unglued
I lose all trace of time
And everything seems to slip my mind
Got to find the right solution (The right solution)
Got to find a way to end all this confusion
In mind, oh, in my mind
This is a brand new feeling, a strange sensation
I just seem to lose my head
Over you, baby
You might also like
Amnesia
I can't remember what you said
What made me go and lose my head
Please understand the things I did
Oh, amnesia
The way you made sweet love to me
Oh, the price you pay for ecstasy
Girl, don't you know what you're doing to me

They say love is blind
They say that love can make you lose your mind (Lose your mind)
No matter what they say, sweet darling
I know our love will shine
All night long, I'll lay beside you
Holding you closer, holding you tighter
Loving you, touchin' and squeezin' you, baby
This is a brand new feeling, a strange sensation
Your kiss makes me lose my head
Oh, I lost it for you, baby

Amnesia
I can't remember what you said
What made me go and lose my head
Please understand the things I did
Oh, amnesia
The way you make sweet love to me
Oh, the price you pay for ecstasy
Don't you know what you're doing to me


Amnesia
I can't remember what you said
What made me go and lose my head
Please understand the things I did
Oh, amnesia
The way you make sweet love to me
Oh, the price you pay for ecstasy
Girl, don't you know what you're doing to me
Oh, amnesia...Embed
