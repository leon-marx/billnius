Lets Go All the Way Lyrics
Sitting with the thinker
Trying to work it out
It's a traffic jam of the brain
Makes you wanna scream and shout
Presidential party
No one wants to dance
Looking for a new star
To put you in a trance

Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Let's go all the way

Workin' in a factory
Eight days a week
Try to make dollar
Damn, what a beat
Cartoon capers
Happen in reality
Rich man, poor man
Livin' in fantasy
You might also like
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
Oh-oh-oh
Let's go all the way
Wow

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Livin' in New York
Looks like an apple core (Apple core)
Asphalt jungle
Got to be a man of war
California dreamers
Sinking in the sand
The Hollywood squares are
Livin' in Disneyland

Weeee! Ha!

Let's go all the way
(Let's go all the way)
Let's go all the way
(Let's go all the way)
Aah-aah-aah
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
Let's go all the way
We need heaven on Earth today
Aah-aah-aah
We can make a better way
Let's go all the way
Go all the way
Let's go all the way
Yeah

Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeah
Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeah
Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeah
Na, na, na-na-na
Na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na-na-na, yeahEmbed
