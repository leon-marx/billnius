We Are the Young Lyrics
We're the ones with the runaway eyes
We're the ones who can improvise
Give us room
And a hot situation
We believe in positive stimulation

(We are the young)
We are the young
With the modern attitude
Breaking down the walls
Breaking all the rules
(We are the young)
Tomorrow comes
And we might go away
So we don't worry bout the price we pay
We are the young
Oh, we are the young
(We are the young)

Every street is an arcade of dreams
I found downtown exploding at the seams
With lights and sounds
And the soul parade
Light and blue color
Promenade
You might also like

Another way to take control
A brand new day to rock and roll

We are the youngEmbed
