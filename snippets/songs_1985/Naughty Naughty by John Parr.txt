Naughty Naughty Lyrics
I put my hand on your stocking
I was movin' nice and slow
Let my fingers do the walking
And there ain't far to go

Don't tell me "I don't wanna be a girl like that"
Do you wanna see a grown man cry?
You don't wanna be a girl like that
Baby this could be the first time (this could be the first time)

Naughty naughty, loud and bawdy, t-t-t-t-tease me
Take it easy, hug and squeeze
A naughty naughty, naughty, I'm a naughty naughty guy

Bedroom eyes, they undress me
Take me, cut me to the bone
Lace and satin pressed against me
Should we call a chaperon

Don't tell me "I don't wanna be a girl like that"
Do you wanna see a grown man cry
You don't wanna be a girl like that
Baby this could be the first time (this could be the first time)
You might also like
Naughty naughty, cute and horny, t-t-t-t-tease me
Take it easy, hug and squeeze me, love outta line

With your hair hung down, and your dress ridin' high
And your eyes burning hot like the sun
Kiss me hard, squeeze me tight, gonna love you alright
Cause I'm a naughty, naughty, naughty guy

You don't wanna be a girl like that
Baby this could be the first time (this could be the first time)

Naughty naughty, cute and horny, t-t-t-t-tease me
Take it easy, hug and squeeze
A naughty naughty, naughty, I'm a naughty naughty (guy)

Naughty naughty, cute and horny, t-t-t-t-tease me
Naughty naughty, loud and bawdy, love outta line
Naughty naughty, loud and bawdy, t-t-t-tease meEmbed
