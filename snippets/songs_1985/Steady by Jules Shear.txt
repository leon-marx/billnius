Steady Lyrics
Friends, they call me on the phone
'Cause I'm steady, ooh I'm steady
Talk about unhappy homes
'Cause I'm steady, ooh I'm steady

Though I don't like to let it show
I got troubles of my own

We push and pull and we fall apart
I'm not gonna die of a broken heart
I just don't want to stop and start
'Cause I'm steady
Ooh, I'm steady

Day to day is so unsure
But I'm steady, ooh I'm steady
I watch people crash and soar
But I'm steady, ooh I'm steady

The more they try so hard to change
The more they stay the same
You might also like
We push and pull and we fall apart
I'm not gonna die of a broken heart
I just don't want to stop and start
'Cause I'm steady
Ooh, I'm steady, ooh yeah


We're faced with so much back and forth
I don't need no ups and downs

We push and pull and we fall apart
I'm not gonna die of a broken heart
I just don't want to stop and start
'Cause I'm steady
Ooh, I'm steady
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm steadyEmbed
