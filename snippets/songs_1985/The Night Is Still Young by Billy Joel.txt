The Night is Still Young Lyrics
I'm young enough to see the passionate boy that I used to be
But I'm old enough to say I got a good look at the other side
I know we got to work real hard, maybe even for the rest of our lives
But right now I just want to take what I can get tonight

While the night is still young
I wanna keep making love to you
While the night is still young

I'd like to settle down, get married and maybe have a child someday
I can see a time coming when I'm gonna throw my suitcase out
No more separations where you have to say goodnight to a telephone
Baby, I decided that ain't what this life is all about

Oh, oh
While the night is still young
I wanna keep making love to you

While the night is still young
I wanna try to make the world brand new
While the night is still young
You might also like
Rock and roll music was the only thing I ever gave a damn about
There was something that was missing but I never used to wonder why
Now I know you're the one who's gonna make things right again
And I may lose the battle but you're giving me the will to try

Oh, oh
While the night is still young
You've got me in love with you

Because the night is still young
I got a lotta catchin' up I gotta do
While the night is still young
While the night is still young
Ooh, ooh
Still young

Oh, oh
While the night is still young
I wanna try and make the world brand new

While the night is still young
I wanna keep making love to you
While the night is still young
While the night is still young
The night is still young
You got me in love, while the night is still young
Got a lotta catchin' up to while the night is still young
Hold on, hold on, hold on
While the night is still young
Tellin' you it's true while the night is still young1Embed
