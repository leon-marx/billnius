Dont Stop LyricsBaby, don't stop
Every time I look at you, my heart starts dancin'
And every little thing you do is so entrancin'
You open up a door, I never knew before
You leave me wanting more n' more n' more
Don't stop when the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane, baby
Don't stop, my whole world's gone crazy
I can't fight this feeling anymore
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hours on the telephone, it's so frustrating
Hanging up and all alone, anticipating
The magic of your touch, that warm electric rush
You keep me rising up and up and up
Don't stop when the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane, baby
Don't stop, my whole world's gone crazy
No use fighting this wild feeling, baby
Don't stop when the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane, baby
Don't stop, my whole world's gone crazy
I can't fight this feeling anymore

Oh-oh-oh-oh...
Oh, baby
You open up a door, I never knew before
You leave me wanting more n' more n' more
Oh...
Don't stop when the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane, baby
Don't stop, my whole world's gone crazy
No use fighting this wild feeling, baby
Don't stop when the love's gone crazy
Never thought I'd ever be sane, baby
Don't stop, my whole world's gone crazy
I can't fight this, no, baby
(Don't stop)
Oh, no, baby, no
(Don't stop)
You know you open up a door
That I never knew before
(Don't stop)
You know you leave me wanting more
