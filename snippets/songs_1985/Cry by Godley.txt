Cry Lyrics
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know what the sound is darling
It's the sound of my tears falling
Or is it the rain?
You don't know

You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie
You make me wanna cry
You make me wanna cry
Cry
You make me wanna cry

You don't know how to ease my pain
You don't know
You don't know how to ease my pain
Don't you hear any voices crying?
That's the sound of our love dying
Here comes the rain

You don't know how to play the game
And you cheat, you lie
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me wanna cry
You don't know
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me wanna cry
You don't even know how to say goodbye
You make me wanna cry
