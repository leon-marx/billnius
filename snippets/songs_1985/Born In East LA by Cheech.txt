Born in East L.A. Lyrics(Cheech:)
Took a walk to the corner store
Just to buy a loaf of bread and a box of s'mores
Up pulled a guy in a yellow van
Shiny gold badge flashing in his hand
(Chong:)
He said, alright all you mojados down here
I want you all to hit the floor
I got one thing to ask you and nothing more
So answer in English, if you can
Where were ya born, man
(Cheech:)
Huh? Where was I born?
(Chong:)
That's right, I said
Where were ya born?
(Cheech:)
Hey, are you one of those dudes who do horoscopes, man
Hey, I'm a Cancer with a bad moon rising
(Chong:)
Look here, el vago, watch my lips
Where were ya born?

Man, I was born in East LA
(Chong:)
Oh yeah, you were born in East LA
Let's see your green card
(Cheech:)
Huh? Green card?
I'm from East LA
(Chong:)
Alright, then who's President of the United States
(Cheech:)
Oh, that's easy, man
That guy that used to be on Death Valley Days, John Wayne
(Chong:)
Alright, let's go, come on
(Cheech:)
Next thing I know, I'm in a foreign land
People talkin so fast, I couldn't understand
There was nobody there to lend a helping hand
I was cold, it was dark where is a burger stand
I want to go back to East LA
I wish I was back in East LA
I don't belong here in downtown TJ
Cause I was born in East LA, ole
I crawled under barbed wire, swam across a stream
Rode in six different trucks packed like a sardine
Walked all day in the burning sun
Now I know what it's like to be born to run
Up ahead was the promised land
Shining like a star just beyond my hand
All I could see was a golden door
I looked up, a sign said five zillion sold
And I was back in East LA
Yes, I was back in East LA
You know I'm never gonna stray
Cause I was born in East LA, orale!
I'm a low rider vato from East LA, cuidate!
East LA, orale!
This ain't no Datsun it's a Chevrolet, cruise all day!
What I say, East LA, orale!
Soto Street (we love it!)
Brooklyn Avenue (we love it!)
City Terrace (naaah!)
Whittier Boulevard (we love it!) orale!
(Hasidic Jew:)
Wilshire! I said, how do you get to Wilshire?
What am I lost or what....?
(Cheech:)
I'm a lowrider vato from a-far away
I was born, I was born in East LA, how to say
East LA, don't delay
Cruise all day in East LA, orale!
I'm from East LA, what I say
East LA.................!
East LA!Embed
