Lucky LyricsAw, aw, aw...
Games, I never used to play
Cause everytime I'd lose
It just turns out that way
I almost lost it all
And then I, I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
In love
My fortunes never changed
And I always took the blame
And I had nothing left to gain
I was just about to quit
And then I, I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
I got lucky
Aw, aw, aw
Aw, aw, aw

Time was always running out
And it took me by surprise
And it filled my life with doubt
I almost lost it all
And then I, I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
I got lucky
Ooh, I got lucky
Yeah, yeah, oh, ohEmbed
