You Are My Lady Lyrics
There's something that I want to say
But words sometimes get in the way
I just want to show my feelings for you
There's nothing that I'd rather do
Than spend every moment with you
I guess you should know, I love you so

You are my lady
You're everything I need and more
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

There's no way that I can resist
Your precious kiss
Girl, you've got me so hypnotized
Just say that you'll stay with me (You'll stay)
'Cause our love was meant to be
I promise to love you more each day

You are my lady (My love)
You're everything I need and more (Oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
You are my lady, yeah (My love)
You're everything I need and more (Oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
You might also like
I love your shine, shine, shine, shine
Let's make it last until the end of time
Ooh, ooh ooh, woo, whoa-ho, oh-ho

You are my lady, yes you are (My love)
You're everything I need and more (Oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for
You are my lady (My love)
You're everything I need and more (Oh, oh, oh)
You are my lady
You're all I'm living for

Go out and tell the world (You are my lady)
That you're my girl (Everything I need and more)
Sweeter than the day, the day, the day before (You are my lady)
Ooh, you're all I'm living for
I love the way you move, girl (You are my lady)
I love you so, yeah (Everything I need and more)
Come on, let me love you, baby, baby (You are my lady)
Ooh, you're all I'm living forEmbed
