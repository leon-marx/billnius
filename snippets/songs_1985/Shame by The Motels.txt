Shame LyricsA very simple statement
A very simple crime
A lot of grief reflecting
In how we spend our time
I want to change things
I want to make a change
I'm tired of spending time
Agonizing yesterdays
Shame on me, shame on you
Shame on every little
Thing that we do
Shame on me, shame on you
Now there's only one
Thing we can do
Another empty day
Another day comes true
A lot of selfish dreams
Are waiting here for you
I've got to have you
I've got no one to blame
It's just the two of us
With nothing left to say but
You might also likeShame on me, shame on you
Shame on every little
Thing that we do
Shame on me, shame on you
Now there's only one
Thing we can do
Shame on me, shame on you
Shame on me, shame on you
I've got to change things
I've got to make a change
I'm tired of spending time
Agonizing yesterdays
Shame on me, shame on you
Shame on every little
Thing that we do
Shame on me, shame on you
Now there's only one
Thing we can do
Shame on me, shame on you
Shame on me, shame on you
Shame on me, shame on you...Embed
