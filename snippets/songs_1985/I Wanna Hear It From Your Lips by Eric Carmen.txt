I Wanna Hear It from Your Lips LyricsI hear it from my friends
I hear it on the street
I hear it in the air here and there
Everywhere and from everyone I meet
And everytime I hear you love me
Oh
My heart skips
But I wanna hear it from your lips
You never told me
You never told me
I wanna hear it from your lips
You never told me
I hear it in my car
I hear it on the phone
I hear it in a crowd nice and loud
But lately now I hear it when I'm all alone
And everytime I hear you love me
Oh
My heart skips
But I wanna hear it from your lips
. .

Iust how good our love is gonna be
But oh
Wee
Oh
Wee
Baby
Baby
You never told me
You never told me
I see it in your eyes
I feel it in your touch
You even found a way you can say all you need
But you never say too much
And if you'd only say you'd love me
Oh
My heart would flip
And I wanna hear it from your lips
You never told me
You never told me
I wanna hear it from your lips
You never told me
You never told me
I wanna hear it from your lips
You never told me
You never told me. . ..Embed
