Get the Bird Lyrics
The game dirty, but the money is dirtier
Better get it while you can, get off your ass, nigga hurry up
They talk a whole lotta shit but that never worry us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)
Let's get it hot, nigga stir it up
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)
Naw, don't act like you've never heard of us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)

Sittin' at the table, starin' at a mountain
For the next couple a hours, I'ma be cookin' and countin'
My gut is kinda old and rushin' so slow your roll
Like Robitussin, 'cause it ain't no discusssion
Triple O-G, I'm certified and some other nouns
You too light in the ass, better call your big brotha down
Or your old man, I'm too heavy to hold man
I brought a six-pack of whoop-ass, you gets a whole can
It's been said before, but let me repeat it
I give the rap game what is needed and undefeated
In a league of my own, so you clones better reckognize
Kobe eatin' Kobe beef, you eatin' Checker's fries
Lyrical exercise, what is this practice?
When it's game time, we puttin' banners in the rafters
Money you can't fit in rubber bands is what we're after
Think we don't want the cheese like Kraft, then ask us
You might also like
The game dirty, but the money is dirtier
Better get it while you can, get off your ass, nigga hurry up
They talk a whole lotta shit but that never worry us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)
Let's get it hot, nigga stir it up
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)
Naw, don't act like you've never heard of us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)

Young nigga tryna touch an M
I make money not friends
Five K for the appearance
Had to take a little break, we been baggin' up for a minute
You should come and join my gym, on weight in a minute
Look, I don't give a fuck about what you claim you did
'Cause me I'm just a see it for myself kinda nigga
We ain't never worried, we the ones with all the guns
KelTec with the beam, choppa-pistols and pumps
Extended clips and drums
It could be a man down, as quick as you count to one
Young underground king, I give 'em the shit they want
Give 'em the shit they miss
Motivate in the streets, that way they never forget
I ain't perfect, but I'm real close
Ain't got no hate in my blood, except when a bitch get on my nerves
Early morning countin' a quarter-mill
Ain't plannin' on slowin' down, I gotta get it while I'm still here
The game dirty, but the money is dirtier
Better get it while you can, get off your ass, nigga hurry up
They talk a whole lotta shit but that never worry us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)
Let's get it hot, nigga stir it up
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)
Naw, don't act like you've never heard of us
Early bird get the worm, I get the bird, 'cause I'm earlier
('Cause I'm earlier)Embed
