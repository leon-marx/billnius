Centipede Lyrics
Centipede
Centipede

Your love is like a raging fire
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire

I feel a longing for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Like a centipede you've got
A lot of loving to touch

Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawling
And the moon starts to glow
Then disappears
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawling
He'll be crying in the night
So many tears
You might also like
Crawling like a centipede
Centipede

You came to strike him with your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To bite him with your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Like a centipede you've got
A lot of loving to touch

Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawling
And the moon starts to glow
Then disappears
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawling
He'll be crying in the night
So many tears

Crawling like a centipede
Centipede

In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawling
And the moon starts to glow
Then disappears
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawling
He'll be crying in the night
So many tears
In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawling
And the moon starts to glow
Then disappears
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawling
He'll be crying in the night
So many tears

Crawling like a centipede
