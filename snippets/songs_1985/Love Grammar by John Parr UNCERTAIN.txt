Love Grammar LyricsYou wanna shake my hand, say there's no hard feelings
But there's another lie between the lines I'm reading
If you want him, then take him, just push me away, baby I just got to know
If you want him, then have him, there's no other way, yeah
I tear your letters up, and flush away the pieces
How does that saying go, you'd love me till hell freezes
You're lyin', I'm dyin' a little each day, girl you know it hurts me so
Stop duckin' and diving, come right out and say
'Cause I can't take no more of this
Love grammar, takin' me and breakin' me up, love grammar, the grammar of love
I before he except after she - knows I'll always be there
Ready or not, she took what I got - to give and she don't care - I before he
Don't wanna lose control, and maybe rock proceedings
Don't fear a new attack, the fact is I'm conceding
If you want him, then take him, don't treat me this way
Cause I just feel like letting go
You want him, you got him, I'm leavin' today
Love grammar, takin' me and breakin' me up, love grammar, the grammar of love
Love grammar, takin' me and breakin' me up, love grammar, the grammar of love
I before he except after she - knows I'll always be there
Ready or not, she took what I got - to give and she don't care
I before he except after she
