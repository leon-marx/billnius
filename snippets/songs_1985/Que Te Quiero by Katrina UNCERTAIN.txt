Lo Que Siento Lyrics
Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home
Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise you are everything I want
This is for you, baby listen, it's your song

Oye carino, solo pienso en ti
When I wake up in the morning until I go back to sleep
How I wish you were mine
I think of you all the time
I always feel like I'm flying
Baby, you make me feel fine
Lost in the words that you say to me
Y pasando tiempo juntos is the ultimate dream
I'm on top of the world
Baby girl, can't you see?
I found my perfect girl
I wanna make you my queen
Time and time again I can be feeling real sad
'Cause mi sueno no se ha hecho una realidad
Pero el tiempo dira, el tiempo dira
If we go spend our lives together lo que el mundo gira
I promise I don't want nobody else to be around me but you
And nobody's touch and nobody's lips can make me feel like yours do
Our hands interlock, nuestros labios se conocen
Nuestra noche es corta pero hermosa we'll be okay
You might also like
Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home
Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise youre everything I want
This is for you, baby listen, it's your song

Sin ti mis dias son largos y se sienten tan amargos
Me ahogo en un lago de mis lagrimas que hago
Can't look forward to my future if it ain't including you
Promise that I'm gonna love you
It's about that time you knew
I swear I don't see nothing better than to lay here with you
And I hope you know I miss you
From my head I can't dismiss you
Eres lo que yo anhelaba en esta vida que me falta
Lo que siento is surreal
I can't lie to you for real
Sabes bien que te quiero
And if you're down to spend your summer with me just let me know
You know youre my sueno
You came to life and now I feel alright

Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home
Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise youre  everything I want
This is for you, baby listen, it's your song
Dreamin' of you when I'm alone
Baby don't trip, I'm comin' home
Kick it with me I don't care if the sun is gone
Baby don't cry when I am gone
Promise youre everything I want
This is for you, baby listen, it's your song
