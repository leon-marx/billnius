Ooh Ooh Song LyricsJust when we think we conquered it
It seems we lose the fight again
But there's just no stoppin' it
It's like a bad dream that never ends
It puts up walls between us that get harder and harder
And harder and harder and harder to remove
But we let it continue, like people in love always do
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Let's not pretend that we're unique
'Cause everybody's tasted love's illusion
We try to hide the fact that we
Got lost between the chaos and confusion
And this love we feel's gettin' deeper and deeper
And deeper and deeper and deeper by the minute
But we let it slip away
'Cause we don't know a good thing while we're in it
