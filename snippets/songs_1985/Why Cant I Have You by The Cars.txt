Why Cant I Have You Lyrics
Dreamy lips, set in motion, flashing
A breathless hush, poundin' soft, lasting
Glossy mouth, a taste untamed, moving
Carousel, up and down, just like you

Oh baby, just one more time to touch you
Just one more time to tell you you're on my mind

Baby, why can't I have you?
You're breakin' my heart in two
You know what I'm goin' through
Oh baby, why can't I have you?

Your candy smile, all the while, glinting
Your eyes like mica, a lethal pout, hinting (felt the pressure)
Ooh, and I felt the pressure, tight and warm, softly striking
(Ooh, tripped and stumbled) Ooh, I tripped and stumbled
I cling forever, I go all night

Oh baby, just one more time to touch you
Just one more time to tell you I'm not so blind
You might also like
Baby, why can't I have you?
Always breakin' my heart in two
You know what I'm goin' through
Uh oh baby, why can't I have you?

(Baby) oh baby (why can't I have you?) why can't I have you?
You know what I'm goin' through
(You're breakin' my heart in two)
You're breakin' my heart, breakin' my heart
(You know what I'm gonna do)
(You're breakin' my heart) breakin' my heart
(Baby) oh baby (why can't I have you?) I need you
(You know what I'm goin' through)
You're breakin' my heart (you're breakin' my heart in two)
Oh baby, I need you so much, I need you, touch
(You know what I'm gonna do)
(You're breakin' my heart)
(Baby) oh baby (why can't I have you?)
(You know what I'm goin' through)
