Lets Talk About Me LyricsLets talk about me for a minute
Well, how do you think
I feel about whats been going on?
Lets talk about me for a minute
Well, how do you think
I feel about whats gone wrong?
Lets talk about dreams
I never learned to read the signs
Lets think about what it all means
I never seem to have the time
Lets talk about you and your problems
All that I seem to do is spend the night
Just talking bout you and your problems
No matter what I say I cant get it right
Dont think about dreams
Is it all a waste of time?
Dont think about what it all means
If you are a friend of mine
Talk about me for a minute
Im the one whos losing
Talk about me for a minute
Im the one whos always losing out
