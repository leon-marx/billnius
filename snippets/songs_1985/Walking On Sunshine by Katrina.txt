Walking on Sunshine Lyrics
Ow!
Hey, yeah!

I used to think maybe you loved me, now, baby, I'm sure
And I just can't wait till the day when you knock on my door
Now every time I go for the mailbox, gotta hold myself down
'Cause I just can't wait till you write me you're coming around

Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good?
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good?
Hey, yeah

I used to think maybe you loved me, now I know that it's true
And I don't want to spend my whole life just a-waiting for you
Now, I don't want you back for the weekend, not back for a day, no, no, no
I said, baby, I just want you back, and I want you to stay

Now I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good?
Yeah, oh, yeah
And don't it feel good?

Ow!

I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
I'm walking on sunshine, whoa
And don't it feel good?
Hey, all right now
And don't it feel good?
I say it, I say it, I say it again, now
And don't it feel good?
Hey, yeah, now
And don't it feel good?
And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good?
I say it, I say it, I say it again, now
And don't it feel good?
And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good?
And tell me, tell me, tell me it again now
And don't it feel good?
Hooh, yeah now
And don't it feel good?
And don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, don't it, and don't it feel good?
Hooh-yeah, hooh-yeah, hooh-yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah3Embed
