Baby Come Back to Me LyricsDit dot ditty dit dot a ditty ditty
Dit dot ditty dit dot a ditty ditty
Dit dot ditty dit dot a ditty ditty
Dit dot ditty, Baby come home to me
I sent my baby a telegram asking to be her man
Begging her to come back home to me (Baby come home to me)
Oh I dotted the I's and I crossed the T's
And I'm begging pretty please
Honey honey, come back home to me (Baby come home to me)
Dit dot?
Baby I want your love
Woo-oo
Baby I need your love
Ooo
Honey honey come back home to me (Come back home to me)
Dit dot?
Got to have your love
Woo-oo
Can't live without your love
Woo-oo
Honey honey come back home to me (Come back home to me)
Oh I made mistakes, yes that's the truth
But the biggest one I made with you
Honey honey, come back home to me (Baby come home to me)
I thought that you would understand
I'm just a one woman man
Not like before so come back home to me (Baby come home to me)
