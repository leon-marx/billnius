Foolish Heart LyricsI need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
That each passing hour
Someone somehow
Will be there, ready to share...
I need a love that's strong
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart play the part
Of the fool again
Before I begin
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
Feeling that feeling again
I'm playing a game I can't win
Love's knocking on the door
Of my heart once more
Think I'll let her in
Before I begin
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore

Foolish, foolish heart
You've been wrong before
(foolish)
(foolish)
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
Foolish heart...
Oh foolish, foolish heart
You've been wrong before
Foolish, foolish heart
Foolish heartEmbed
