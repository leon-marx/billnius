Epicne ~  Act 5. Scene 1 LyricsA ROOM IN MOROSE'S HOUSE.
ENTER LA-FOOLE, CLERIMONT, AND DAW.
La-F:
Where had you our swords, master Clerimont?
Cler:
Why, Dauphine took them from the madman.
La-F:
And he took them from our boys, I warrant you.
Cler:
Very like, sir.
La-F:
Thank you, good master Clerimont. Sir John Daw and I are
both beholden to you.
Cler:
Would I knew how to make you so, gentlemen!
Daw:
Sir Amorous and I are your servants, sir.

Mav:
Gentlemen, have any of you a pen and ink? I would fain write
out a riddle in Italian, for sir Dauphine, to translate.
Cler:
Not I, in troth lady; I am no scrivener.
Daw:
I can furnish you, I think, lady.

Cler:
He has it in the haft of a knife, I believe.
La-F:
No, he has his box of instruments.
Cler:
Like a surgeon!
La-F:
For the mathematics: his square, his compasses, his brass
pens, and black-lead, to draw maps of every place and person
where he comes.
Cler:
How, maps of persons!
La-F:
Yes, sir, of Nomentack when he was here, and of the Prince of
Moldavia, and of his mistress, mistress Epicoene.

Cler:
Away! he hath not found out her latitude, I hope.
La-F:
You are a pleasant gentleman, sir.
Cler:
Faith, now we are in private, let's wanton it a little, and
talk waggishly.Sir John, I am telling sir Amorous here, that you
two govern the ladies wherever you come; you carry the feminine
gender afore you.
Daw:
They shall rather carry us afore them, if they will, sir.
Cler:
Nay, I believe that they do, withalbut that you are the
prime men in their affections, and direct all their actions
Daw:
Not I: sir Amorous is.
La-F:
I protest, sir John is.
Daw:
As I hope to rise in the state, sir Amorous, you have the
person.
La-F:
Sir John, you have the person, and the discourse too.
Daw:
Not I, sir. I have no discourseand then you have activity
beside.
La-F:
I protest, sir John, you come as high from Tripoly as I do,
every whit: and lift as many join'd stools, and leap over them,
if you would use it.
Cler:
Well, agree on't together knights; for between you, you
divide the kingdom or commonwealth of ladies' affections: I see
it, and can perceive a little how they observe you, and fear you,
indeed. You could tell strange stories, my masters, if you would,
I know.
Daw:
Faith, we have seen somewhat, sir.
La-F:
That we havevelvet petticoats, and wrought smocks, or so.
Daw:
Ay, and
Cler:
Nay, out with it, sir John: do not envy your friend the
pleasure of hearing, when you have had the delight of tasting.
Daw:
Whyado you speak, sir Amorous.
La-F:
No, do you, sir John Daw.
Daw:
I'faith, you shall.
La-F:
I'faith, you shall.
Daw:
Why, we have been
La-F:
In the great bed at Ware together in our time. On, sir
John.
Daw:
Nay, do you, sir Amorous.
Cler:
And these ladies with you, knights?
La-F:
No, excuse us, sir.
Daw:
We must not wound reputation.
La-F:
No matterthey were these, or others. Our bath cost us
fifteen pound when we came home.
Cler:
Do you hear, sir John? You shall tell me but one thing
truly, as you love me.
Daw:
If I can, I will, sir.
Cler:
You lay in the same house with the bride, here?
Daw:
Yes, and conversed with her hourly, sir.
Cler:
And what humour is she of? Is she coming, and open, free?
Daw:
O, exceeding open, sir. I was her servant, and sir Amorous was
to be.
Cler:
Come, you have both had favours from her: I know, and have
heard so much.
Daw:
O no, sir.
La-F:
You shall excuse us, sir: we must not wound reputation.
Cler:
Tut, she is married now, and you cannot hurt her with any
report; and therefore speak plainly: how many times, i'faith?
which of you led first? ha!
La-F:
Sir John had her maidenhead, indeed.
Daw:
O, it pleases him to say so, sir, but sir Amorous knows what
is what, as well.
Cler:
Dost thou i'faith, Amorous?
La-F:
In a manner, sir.
Cler:
Why, I commend you lads. Little knows don Bridegroom of
this. Nor shall he, for me.
Daw:
Hang him, mad ox!
Cler:
Speak softly: here comes his nephew, with the lady Haughty.
He'll get the ladies from you, sirs, if you look not to him in
time.
La-F:
Why, if he do, we'll fetch them home again, I warrant you.


Hau:
I assure you, sir Dauphine, it is the price and estimation
of your virtue only, that hath embark'd me to this adventure; and
I could not but make out to tell you so; nor can I repent me of
the act, since it is always an argument of some virtue in our
selves, that we love and affect it so in others.
Daup:
Your ladyship sets too high a price on my weakness.
Hau:
Sir, I can distinguish gems from pebbles
Daup :
Are you so skilful in stones?
Hau:
And howsover I may suffer in such a judgment as yours, by
admitting equality of rank or society with Centaure or Mavis
Daup:
You do not, madam; I perceive they are your mere foils.
Hau:
Then, are you a friend to truth, sir; it makes me love you
the more. It is not the outward, but the inward man that I affect.
They are not apprehensive of an eminent perfection, but love flat,
and dully.
Cen :
Where are you, my lady Haughty?
Hau:
I come presently, Centaure.My chamber, sir, my page shall
shew you; and Trusty, my woman, shall be ever awake for you: you
need not fear to communicate any thing with her, for she is a
Fidelia. I pray you wear this jewel for my sake, sir Dauphine.

Where is Mavis, Centaure?
Cen:
Within, madam, a writing. I'll follow you presently:

I'll but speak a word with sir Dauphine.
Daup:
With me, madam?
Cen:
Good sir Dauphine, do not trust Haughty, nor make any credit
to her, whatever you do besides. Sir Dauphine, I give you this
caution, she is a perfect courtier, and loves nobody but for her
uses: and for her uses she loves all. Besides, her physicians give
her out to be none o' the clearest, whether she pay them or no,
heaven knows: and she's above fifty too, and pargets! See her in
a forenoon. Here comes Mavis, a worse face then she! you would
not like this, by candle-light.

If you'll come to my chamber one o' these mornings early, or late
in an evening, I will tell you more. Where's Haughty, Mavis?
Mav:
Within, Centaure.
Cen:
What have you, there?
Mav:
An Italian riddle for sir Dauphine,you shall not see it
i'faith, Centaure.

Good sir Dauphine, solve it for me. I'll call for it anon.

Cler :
How now, Dauphine! how dost thou quit
thyself of these females?
Daup:
'Slight, they haunt me like fairies, and give me jewels
here; I cannot be rid of them.
Cler:
O, you must not tell though.
Daup:
Mass, I forgot that: I was never so assaulted. One loves
for virtue, and bribes me with this;
another loves me with caution, and so would possess me; a
third brings me a riddle here: and all are jealous: and rail each
at other.
Cler:
A riddle! pray let me see it.
Sir Dauphine, I chose this way of intimation for privacy. The
ladies here, I know, have both hope and purpose to make a
collegiate and servant of you. If I might be so honoured, as to
appear at any end of so noble a work, I would enter into a fame
of taking physic to-morrow, and continue it four or five days,
or longer, for your visitation. Mavis.
By my faith, a subtle one! Call you this a riddle? what's their
plain dealing, trow?
Daup:
We lack Truewit to tell us that.
Cler:
We lack him for somewhat else too: his knights reformadoes
are wound up as high and insolent as ever they were.
Daup:
You jest.
Cler:
No drunkards, either with wine or vanity, ever confess'd
such stories of themselves. I would not give a fly's leg, in
balance against all the womens' reputations here, if they could
be but thought to speak truth: and for the bride, they have made
their affidavit against her directly
Daup:
What, that they have lain with her?
Cler:
Yes; and tell times and circumstances, with the cause why,
and the place where. I had almost brought them to affirm that they
had done it to-day.
Daup:
Not both of them?
Cler:
Yes, faith: with a sooth or two more I had effected it.
They would have set it down under their hands.
Daup:
Why, they will be our sport, I see, still, whether we will
or no.

True:
O, are you here? Come, Dauphine; go call your uncle
presently: I have fitted my divine, and my canonist, dyed
their beards and all. The knaves do not know themselves, they
are so exalted and altered. Preferment changes any man. Thou
shalt keep one door and I another, and then Clerimont in the
midst, that he may have no means of escape from their cavilling,
when they grow hot once again. And then the women, as I have
given the bride her instructions, to break in upon him in the
l'enuoy. O, 'twill be full and twanging! Away! fetch him.


Come, master doctor, and master parson, look to your parts now,
and discharge them bravely: you are well set forth, perform it
as well. If you chance to be out, do not confess it with standing
still, or humming, or gaping one at another: but go on, and talk
aloud and eagerly; use vehement action, and only remember your
terms, and you are safe. Let the matter go where it will: you
have many will do so. But at first be very solemn, and grave like
your garments, though you loose your selves after, and skip out
like a brace of jugglers on a table. Here he comes: set your
faces, and look superciliously, while I present you.

Mor:
Are these the two learned men?
True:
Yes, sir; please you salute them.
Mor:
Salute them! I had rather do any thing, than wear out time so
unfruitfully, sir. I wonder how these common forms, as God save
you, and You are welcome, are come to be a habit in our lives:
or, I am glad to see you! when I cannot see what the profit can
be of these words, so long as it is no whit better with him whose
affairs are sad and grievous, that he hears this salutation.
True:
'Tis true, sir; we'll go to the matter then.Gentlemen,
master doctor, and master parson, I have acquainted you
sufficiently with the business for which you are come hither; and
you are not now to inform yourselves in the state of the question,
I know. This is the gentleman who expects your resolution, and
therefore, when you please, begin.
Ott:
Please you, master doctor.
Cut:
Please you, good master parson.
Ott:
I would hear the canon-law speak first.
Cut:
It must give place to positive divinity, sir.
Mor:
Nay, good gentlemen, do not throw me into circumstances. Let
your comforts arrive quickly at me, those that are. Be swift in
affording me my peace, if so I shall hope any. I love not your
disputations, or your court-tumults. And that it be not strange to
you, I will tell you: My father, in my education, was wont to
advise me, that I should always collect and contain my mind, not
suffering it to flow loosely; that I should look to what things
were necessary to the carriage of my life, and what not; embracing
the one and eschewing the other: in short, that I should endear
myself to rest, and avoid turmoil: which now is grown to be
another nature to me. So that I come not to your public pleadings,
or your places of noise; not that I neglect those things that make
for the dignity of the commonwealth: but for the mere avoiding
of clamours and impertinencies of orators, that know not how to be silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a suitor to you. You
do not know in what a misery I have been exercised this day, what
a torrent of evil! my very house turns round with the tumult! I
dwell in a windmill: The perpetual motion is here, and not at
Eltham.
True:
Well, good master doctor, will you break the ice? master
parson will wade after.
Cut:
Sir, though unworthy, and the weaker, I will presume.
Ott:
'Tis no presumption, domine doctor.
Mor:
Yet again!
Cut:
Your question is, For how many causes a man may have
divortium legitimum, a lawful divorce? First, you must understand
the nature of the word, divorce, a divertendo
Mor:
No excursions upon words, good doctor, to the question briefly.
Cut:
I answer then, the canon-law affords divorce but in a few
cases; and the principal is in the common case, the adulterous
case: But there are duodecim impedimenta, twelve impediments, as we call them, all which do not dirimere contractum, but irritum
reddere matrimonium, as we say in the canon-law, not take away the bond, but cause a nullity therein.
Mor:
I understood you before: good sir, avoid your impertinency of
translation.
Ott:
He cannot open this too much, sir, by your favour.
Mor:
Yet more!
True:
O, you must give the learned men leave, sir.To your
impediments, master Doctor.
Cut:
The first is impedimentum erroris.
Ott:
Of which there are several species.
Cut:
Ay, as error personae.
Ott:
If you contract yourself to one person, thinking her another.
Cut:
Then, error fortunae.
Ott:
If she be a begger, and you thought her rich.
Cut:
Then, error qualitatis.
Ott:
If she prove stubborn or head-strong, that you thought
obedient.
Mor:
How! is that, sir, a lawful impediment? One at once, I pray
you gentlemen.
Ott:
Ay, ante copulam, but not post copulam, sir.
Cut:
Master Parson says right. Nec post nuptiarum benedictionem.
It doth indeed but irrita reddere sponsalia, annul the contract:
after marriage it is of no obstancy.
True:
Alas, sir, what a hope are we fallen from by this time!
Cut:
The next is conditio: if you thought her free born, and she
prove a bond-woman, there is impediment of estate and condition.
Ott:
Ay, but, master doctor, those servitudes are sublatae now,
among us Christians.
Cut:
By your favour, master parson
Ott:
You shall give me leave, master doctor.
Mor:
Nay, gentlemen, quarrel not in that question; it concerns not
my case: pass to the third.
Cut:
Well then, the third is votum: if either party have made a
vow of chastity. But that practice, as master parson said of the
other, is taken away among us, thanks be to discipline. The fourth
is cognatio: if the persons be of kin within the degrees.
Ott:
Ay: do you know what the degrees are, sir?
Mor:
No, nor I care not, sir: they offer me no comfort in the
question, I am sure.
Cut:
But there is a branch of this impediment may, which is
cognatio spiritualis: if you were her godfather, sir, then the
marriage is incestuous.
Ott:
That comment is absurd and superstitious, master doctor: I
cannot endure it. Are we not all brothers and sisters, and as much
akin in that, as godfathers and god-daughters?
Mor:
O me! to end the controversy, I never was a godfather, I
never was a godfather in my life, sir. Pass to the next.
Cut:
The fifth is crimen adulterii; the known case. The sixth,
cultus disparitas, difference of religion: have you ever examined
her, what religion she is of?
Mor:
No, I would rather she were of none, than be put to the
trouble of it!
Ott:
You may have it done for you, sir.
Mor:
By no means, good sir; on to the rest: shall you ever come
to an end, think you?
True:
Yes, he has done half, sir. On, to the rest.Be patient,
and expect, sir.
Cut:
The seventh is, vis: if it were upon compulsion or force.
Mor:
O no, it was too voluntary, mine; too voluntary.
Cut:
The eight is, ordo; if ever she have taken holy orders.
Ott:
That's supersitious too.
Mor:
No matter, master parson: Would she would go into a nunnery
yet.
Cut:
The ninth is, ligamen; if you were bound, sir, to any other
before.
Mor:
I thrust myself too soon into these fetters.
Cut:
The tenth is, publica honestas: which is inchoata quaedam
affinitas.
Ott:
Ay, or affinitas orta ex sponsalibus; and is but leve
impedimentum.
Mor:
I feel no air of comfort blowing to me, in all this.
Cut:
The eleventh is, affinitas ex fornicatione.
Ott:
Which is no less vera affinitas, than the other, master
doctor.
Cut:
True, quae oritur ex legitimo matrimonio.
Ott:
You say right, venerable doctor: and, nascitur ex eo, quod
per conjugium duae personae efficiuntur una caro
Mor:
Hey-day, now they begin!
Cut:
I conceive you, master parson: ita per fornicationem aeque
est verus pater, qui sic generat
Ott:
Et vere filius qui sic generatur
Mor:
What's all this to me?
Cler:
Now it grows warm.
Cut:
The twelfth, and last is, si forte coire nequibis.
Ott:
Ay, that is impedimentum gravissimum: it doth utterly annul,
and annihilate, that. If you have manifestam frigiditatem, you
are well, sir.
True:
Why, there is comfort come at length, sir. Confess yourself
but a man unable, and she will sue to be divorced first.
Ott:
Ay, or if there be morbus perpetuus, et insanabilis; as
paralysis, elephantiasis, or so
Daup:
O, but frigiditas is the fairer way, gentlemen.
Ott:
You say troth, sir, and as it is in the canon, master
doctor
Cut:
I conceive you, sir.
Cler:
Before he speaks!
Ott:
That a boy, or child, under years, is not fit for marriage,
because he cannot reddere debitum. So your omnipotentes
True :
Your impotentes, you whoreson lobster!
Ott:
Your impotentes, I should say, are minime apti ad
contrahenda matrimonium.
True:
Matrimonium! we shall have most unmatrimonial Latin with
you: matrimonia, and be hang'd.
Daup:
You put them out, man.
Cut:
But then there will arise a doubt, master parson, in our
case, post matrimonium: that frigiditate praeditusdo you
conceive me, sir?
Ott:
Very well, sir.
Cut:
Who cannot uti uxore pro uxore, may habere eam pro sorore.
Ott:
Absurd, absurd, absurd, and merely apostatical!
Cut:
You shall pardon me, master parson, I can prove it.
Ott:
You can prove a will, master doctor, you can prove nothing
else. Does not the verse of your own canon say,
Haec socianda vetant connubia, facta retractant?
Cut:
I grant you; but how do they retractare, master parson?
Mor:
O, this was it I feared.
Ott:
In aeternum, sir.
Cut:
That's false in divinity, by your favour.
Ott:
'Tis false in humanity to say so. Is he not prorsus inutilis
ad thorum? Can he praestare fidem datam? I would fain know.
Cut:
Yes; how if he do convalere?
Ott:
He cannot convalere, it is impossible.
True:
Nay, good sir, attend the learned men, they will think you
neglect them else.
Cut:
Or, if he do simulare himself frigidum, odio uxoris, or so?
Ott:
I say, he is adulter manifestus then.
Daup:
They dispute it very learnedly, i'faith.
Ott:
And prostitutor uxoris; and this is positive.
Mor:
Good sir, let me escape.
True:
You will not do me that wrong, sir?
Ott:
And, therefore, if he be manifeste frigidus, sir
Cut:
Ay, if he be manifeste frigidus, I grant you
Ott:
Why, that was my conclusion.
Cut:
And mine too.
True:
Nay, hear the conclusion, sir.
Ott:
Then, frigiditatis causa
Cut:
Yes, causa frigiditatis
Mor:
O, mine ears!
Ott:
She may have libellum divortii against you.
Cut:
Ay, divortii libellum she will sure have.
Mor:
Good echoes, forbear.
Ott:
If you confess it.
Cut:
Which I would do, sir
Mor:
I will do any thing.
Ott:
And clear myself in foro conscientiae
Cut:
Because you want indeed
Mor:
Yet more?
Ott:
Exercendi potestate.

Epi:
I will not endure it any longer. Ladies, I beseech you,
help me. This is such a wrong as never was offered to poor
bride before: upon her marriage day, to have her husband
conspire against her, and a couple of mercenary companions
to be brought in for form's sake, to persuade a separation!
If you had blood or virtue in you, gentlemen, you would not
suffer such ear-wigs about a husband, or scorpions to creep
between man and wife.
Mor:
O the variety and changes of my torment!
Hau:
Let them be cudgell'd out of doors, by our grooms.
Cen:
I'll lend you my foot-man.
Mav:
We'll have our men blanket them in the hall.
Mrs. Ott:
As there was one at our house, madam, for peeping
in at the door.
Daw:
Content, i'faith.
True:
Stay, ladies and gentlemen; you'll hear, before you proceed?
Mav:
I'd have the bridegroom blanketted too.
Cen:
Begin with him first.
Hau:
Yes, by my troth.
Mor:
O mankind generation!
Daup:
Ladies, for my sake forbear.
Hau:
Yes, for sir Dauphine's sake.
Cen:
He shall command us.
La-F:
He is as fine a gentleman of his inches, madam, as any
is about the town, and wears as good colours when he lists.
True:
Be brief, sir, and confess your infirmity, she'll be a-fire
to be quit of you, if she but hear that named once, you shall not
entreat her to stay: she'll fly you like one that had the marks
upon him.
Mor:
Ladies, I must crave all your pardons
True:
Silence, ladies.
Mor:
For a wrong I have done to your whole sex, in marrying this
fair, and virtuous gentlewoman
Cler:
Hear him, good ladies.
Mor:
Being guilty of an infirmity, which, before I conferred
with these learned men, I thought I might have concealed
True:
But now being better informed in his conscience by them,
he is to declare it, and give satisfaction, by asking your public
forgiveness.
Mor:
I am no man, ladies.
All:
How!
Mor:
Utterly unabled in nature, by reason of frigidity, to
perform the duties, or any the least office of a husband.
Mav:
Now out upon him, prodigious creature!
Cen:
Bridegroom uncarnate!
Hau:
And would you offer it to a young gentlewoman?
Mrs. Ott:
A lady of her longings?
Epi:
Tut, a device, a device, this, it smells rankly, ladies.
A mere comment of his own.
True:
Why, if you suspect that, ladies, you may have him
search'd
Daw:
As the custom is, by a jury of physicians.
La-F:
Yes faith, 'twill be brave.
Mor:
O me, must I undergo that?
Mrs. Ott:
No, let women search him, madam: we can do it
ourselves.
Mor:
Out on me! worse.
Epi:
No, ladies, you shall not need, I will take him with all
his faults.
Mor:
Worst of all!
Cler:
Why then, 'tis no divorce, doctor, if she consent not?
Cut:
No, if the man be frigidus, it is de parte uxoris, that we
grant libellum divortii, in the law.
Ott:
Ay, it is the same in theology.
Mor:
Worse, worse than worst!
True:
Nay, sir, be not utterly disheartened; we have yet a
small relic of hope left, as near as our comfort is blown
out. Clerimont, produce your brace of knights. What was that,
master parson, you told me in errore qualitatis, e'en now?
Dauphine, whisper the bride, that she carry it as if she were
guilty, and ashamed.
Ott:
Marry, sir, in errore qualitatis (which master doctor did
forbear to urge,) if she be found corrupta, that is, vitiated or
broken up, that was pro virgine desponsa, espoused for a maid
Mor:
What then, sir?
Ott:
It doth dirimere contractum, and irritum reddere too.
True:
If this be true, we are happy again, sir, once more. Here
are an honourable brace of knights, that shall affirm so much.
Daw:
Pardon us, good master Clerimont.
La-F:
You shall excuse us, master Clerimont.
Cler:
Nay, you must make it good now, knights, there is no remedy;
I'll eat no words for you, nor no men: you know you spoke it to
me.
Daw:
Is this gentleman-like, sir?
True :
Jack Daw, he's worse then sir Amorous;
fiercer a great deal.
Sir Amorous, beware, there be ten Daws in
this Clerimont.
La-F:
I'll confess it, sir.
Daw:
Will you, sir Amorous, will you wound reputation?
La-F:
I am resolved.
True:
So should you be too, Jack Daw: what should keep you off?
she's but a woman, and in disgrace: he'll be glad on't.
Daw:
Will he? I thought he would have been angry.
Cler:
You will dispatch, knights, it must be done, i'faith.
True:
Why, an it must, it shall, sir, they say: they'll ne'er
go back.
Do not tempt his patience.
Daw:
It is true indeed, sir?
La-F:
Yes, I assure you, sir.
Mor:
What is true gentlemen? what do you assure me?
Daw:
That we have known your bride, sir
La-F:
In good fashion. She was our mistress, or so
Cler:
Nay, you must be plain, knights, as you were to me.
Ott:
Ay, the question is, if you have carnaliter, or no?
La-F:
Carnaliter! what else, sir?
Ott:
It is enough: a plain nullity.
Epi:
I am undone, I am undone!
Mor:
O, let me worship and adore you, gentlemen!
Epi :
I am undone!
Mor:
Yes, to my hand, I thank these knights.
Master parson, let me thank you otherwise. 
Hau:
And have they confess'd?
Mav:
Now out upon them, informers!
True:
You see what creatures you may bestow your favours
on, madams.
Hau:
I would except against them as beaten knights, wench,
and not good witnesses in law.
Mrs. Ott:
Poor gentlewoman, how she takes it!
Hau:
Be comforted, Morose, I love you the better for't.
Cen:
so do I, I protest.
Cut:
But, gentlemen, you have not known her since matrimonium?
Daw:
Not to-day, master doctor.
La-F:
No, sir, not to-day.
Cut:
Why, then I say, for any act before, the matrimonium is good
and perfect: unless the worshipful bridegroom did precisely,
before witness, demand, if she were virgo ante nuptias.
Epi:
No, that he did not, I assure you, master doctor.
Cut:
If he cannot prove that, it is ratum conjugium,
notwithstanding the premisses. And they do no way impedire. And
this is my sentence, this I pronounce.
Ott:
I am of master doctor's resolution too, sir: if you made
not that demand, ante nuptias.
Mor:
O my heart! wilt thou break? wilt thou break? this is worst
of all worst worsts that hell could have devised! Marry a whore,
and so much noise!
Daup:
Come, I see now plain confederacy in this doctor and this
parson, to abuse a gentleman. You study his affliction. I pray
be gone companions.And, gentlemen, I begin to suspect you for
having parts with them.Sir, will it please you hear me?
Mor:
O do not talk to me, take not from me the pleasure of dying
in silence, nephew.
Daup:
Sir, I must speak to you. I have been long your poor
despised kinsman, and many a hard thought has strengthened
you against me: but now it shall appear if either I love you
or your peace, and prefer them to all the world beside. I will
not be long or grievous to you, sir. If I free you of this
unhappy match absolutely, and instantly, after all this
trouble, and almost in your despair, now
Mor:
It cannot be.
Daup:
Sir, that you be never troubled with a murmur of it more,
what shall I hope for, or deserve of you?
Mor:
O, what thou wilt, nephew! thou shalt deserve me, and have
me.
Daup:
Shall I have your favour perfect to me, and love hereafter?
Mor:
That, and any thing beside. Make thine own conditions. My
whole estate is thine; manage it, I will become thy ward.
Daup:
Nay, sir, I will not be so unreasonable.
Epi:
Will sir Dauphine be mine enemy too?
Daup:
You know I have been long a suitor to you, uncle, that
out of your estate, which is fifteen hundred a-year, you
would allow me but five hundred during life, and assure the
rest upon me after: to which I have often, by myself and
friends tendered you a writing to sign, which you would never
consent or incline to. If you please but to effect it now
Mor:
Thou shalt have it, nephew: I will do it, and more.
Daup:
If I quit you not presently, and for ever of this
cumber, you shall have power instantly, afore all these, to
revoke your act, and I will become whose slave you will give
me to, for ever.
Mor:
Where is the writing? I will seal to it, that, or to a
blank, and write thine own conditions.
Epi:
O me, most unfortunate, wretched gentlewoman!
Hau:
Will sir Dauphine do this?
Epi:
Good sir, have some compassion on me.
Mor:
O, my nephew knows you, belike; away, crocodile!
Hau:
He does it not sure without good ground.
Daup:
Here, sir. 
Mor:
Come, nephew, give me the pen. I will subscribe to any
thing, and seal to what thou wilt, for my deliverance. Thou
art my restorer. Here, I deliver it thee as my deed. If there
be a word in it lacking, or writ with false orthography, I
protest before  I will not take the advantage.

Daup:
Then here is your release, sir.
You have married a boy, a gentleman's son, that I have
brought up this half year at my great charges, and for this
composition, which I have now made with you.What say you,
master doctor? This is justum impedimentum, I hope, error
personae?
Ott:
Yes sir, in primo gradu.
Cut:
In primo gradu.
Daup:
I thank you, good doctor Cutbeard, and parson Otter.
You are beholden to them, sir, that have taken this pains for
you; and my friend, master Truewit, who enabled them for the
business. Now you may go in and rest; be as private as you
will, sir.

I'll not trouble you, till you trouble me with your funeral,
which I care not how soon it come.
Cutbeard, I'll make your lease good. "Thank me not, but with
your leg, Cutbeard." And Tom Otter, your princess shall be
reconciled to you.How now, gentlemen, do you look at me?
CLER:
A boy!
Daup:
Yes, mistress Epicoene.
True:
Well, Dauphine, you have lurch'd your friends of the
better half of the garland, by concealing this part of the
plot: but much good do it thee, thou deserv'st it, lad. And,
Clerimont, for thy unexpected bringing these two to
confession, wear my part of it freely. Nay, sir Daw, and sir
La-Foole, you see the gentlewoman that has done you the
favours! we are all thankful to you, and so should the
woman-kind here, specially for lying on her, though not
with her! you meant so, I am sure? But that we have stuck it
upon you to-day, in your own imagined persons, and so lately,
this Amazon, the champion of the sex, should beat you now
thriftily, for the common slanders which ladies receive from
such cuckoos as you are. You are they that, when no merit or
fortune can make you hope to enjoy their bodies, will yet
lie with their reputations, and make their fame suffer. Away,
you common moths of these, and all ladies' honours. Go,
travel to make legs and faces, and come home with some new
matter to be laugh'd at: you deserve to live in an air as
corrupted as that wherewith you feed rumour.

Madams, you are mute, upon this new metamorphosis! But here
stands she that has vindicated your fames. Take heed of such
insectae hereafter. And let it not trouble you, that you
have discovered any mysteries to this young gentleman: he is
almost of years, and will make a good visitant within this
twelvemonth. In the mean time, we'll all undertake for his
secrecy, that can speak so well of his silence.

Spectators, if you like this comedy, rise cheerfully, and
now Morose is gone in, clap your hands. It may be, that noise
will cure him, at least please him.
