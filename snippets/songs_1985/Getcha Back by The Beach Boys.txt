Getcha Back Lyrics

The other night, they were playing our song
Haven't heard it for oh, so long
Took me back, darling, to that time in my car
When you cried all night 'cause we'd gone too far

Can I ever getcha back? (Getcha back, baby)
Gonna getcha back, yeah (Getcha back)
Getcha back (Getcha back, baby)
Gonna getcha back, yeah (Getcha back)
Can I ever getcha back?

I'm getting tired, layin' around here at night
Thinking 'bout some other guy holdin' you tight
He may have money and a brand new car
May even treat you like a movie star
And no matter what he ever do for you
He can never love you like I can do
So if I leave her and you leave him
Can we ever get back again?

Getcha back (Getcha back, baby)
Gonna getcha back, yeah (Getcha back)
Getcha back (Getcha back, baby)
Gonna getcha back, yeah (Getcha back)
Can I ever getcha back?
You might also like
(Getcha back) If I leave her
(Gonna getcha back, yeah) And you leave him
(Getcha back) Can we, baby
(Gonna getcha back, yeah) Get back again?
(Getcha back) If I leave her
(Gonna getcha back, yeah) And you leave him
(Getcha back) Can we, baby
(Gonna getcha back, yeah) Get back again?
(Getcha back) If I leave her
(Gonna getcha back, yeah) And you leave him...Embed
