Black Cars LyricsOoh!
Under the cover of night
She crawls into sight
Her skin is cold, china white
She's a dark angel wearing dark glasses
Dark shadows under long false lashes
Hey!
The light exposes the cracks
She wears her makeup like wax
Ooo, to hide every scratch
'Cause she a dark angel riding dark horses
Sitting pretty in her dim lit corners ...
I say
Black cars look better in the shade
Black cars
She smears her lipstick on right before she sleeps
For all those phantom lovers in her dreams
She smokes them French cigarettes
In cocktail gloves and a strapless dress
She cuts a perfect silhouette

A fading beauty as the night time passes
I say
Black cars look better in the shade
Black cars
Black cars look better in the shade
Black cars
Black cars look better in the
Black cars
Black cars look better in the Hey!
Shade
Shade
Hey, hey, hey
Hey hey
Hey heyEmbed
