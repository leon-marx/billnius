Gotta Get You Home Tonight LyricsOoooh baby
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Ooooh baby
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Gotta hold your body tight
Make you scream and shout all night
I'll do those things
That are good... to you lady..
I've got the tools. I'm sure you gonna like...
So kick off you shoes
And lay back and let me soothe you
I'm in No rush
I'll take my time..
A bottle of Dom Perignon
To get us in the mood
And an atmosphere
That's sure to please you..
Oooooh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Ooooh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight
You might also likeGotta hold your body right
Make you scream shout all night
I'll do those things.. that are good to you lady...
When you lay your body next to mine
So, kick off your shoes
And lay back and let me soothe you...
I'm in no rush..
I'll take my time...
A bottle of Dom Perignon
To get us in the mood
And an atmosphere
That's sure to please you..
Oooooh lady
Gotta get you home with me tonight
Ooooh lady
I gotta get you home with me tonight
Bridge:
So come on lady
Let's get into the groove
I've got to get next to you..
No matter what it takes
So come let dance
And make a little romance...
Oh come on lady!
Oh come on girl!
Oh come On girl!
