Wake Up (Next to You) LyricsI can't have no objection to the world outside
I don't have no complaints against life's one way ride
I know I'm sleeping with an angel and this devil's in luck
Oooooooh wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
I've been dreamin for too long
I guess something's always wrong unless I
Wake up, next to you, I wanna
Wake up, next to you you
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Oooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, yeah
The Summer's left a spell on us, magic and gold
The tarmac's cracked and shimmering, up on the road
I know I'm walking with an angel down a hot avenue
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
I've been dreamin for too long
I guess something's always wrong unless I
Wake up, next to you, I'm gonna wake up
Wake up, next to you ooooooo (Sax solo)
(Spoken)
You know what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna pick up the telephone
Right now and I'm gonna call information and I'm gonna say to 'em
"Where is she right now? Cause I want you and I need you"
And I wanna hear her say: "Hey baby, Wake up!"

Wake up, next to you you
Oooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
Oooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, ooh ooh, yeahEmbed
