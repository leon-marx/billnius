Call To The Heart LyricsCan I ever live without you girl?
Get back on my feet again
Now I'm lost in your world
And there's no simple way to let you go
When you've been such a part of me
And though you choose to walk a separate road
I still believe in you
So I call to your heart, hear me calling to you
Oh, I call to your heart, I'm calling to you
Distant voices in the silent night, call to a memory
Someone touched me but it don't feel right
It's only you I need
When I call to your heart
Can you hear all the times
When I call to your heart
Calling to you, Calling to you
Call to your heart
Your love I lost along the way
But darling, I'll find you someday
Darlin', you remember the dreams that we had
I'd give everything, my world, to hold you again
And darlin', together, we can make it work out
So stay with me baby, I need you now
I call to your heart, hear me calling to you
Hear me call to your heart, hear me calling to you
Calling to you
I'll call to your heart, call to your heart
Hear me calling to you, to your heartYou might also likeEmbed
