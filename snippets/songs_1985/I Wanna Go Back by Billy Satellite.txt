I Wanna Go Back Lyrics
I was listening to the radio
Heard a song, reminded me of long ago
Back then, I thought that things were never gonna change
It used to be that I never had to feel the pain
I know now that things will never be the same

I wanna go back (Go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know

I recall hanging out on Friday night
My first slow dance, hoping that I'll get it right
Back then, I thought I would never ever stand alone
It used to be that a lonely heart was never shown
I know now that things will never be the same

I wanna go back (Go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know
Ooh, yeah
You might also like
I know that things will never be the same

I wanna go back (Go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I know
Wanna go back (Go back)
Do it all over
Can't go back, I know
Wanna go back again
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
I wanna go back (Go back)
And do it all over
Can't go back, I know
I wanna go back (Go back)
'Cause I'm feeling so much older
But I can't go back, I knowEmbed
