I Need You Tonight LyricsWhen the music stops, I walk you to your door
I say goodnight, like a thousand times before
This is the night, I just can't walk away
This is the night, I need you even more
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I need you tonight
I drive away, but you're still on my mind
It's getting so hard, leaving you behind
This is the night, I just want you to know
This is the night, I just can't let you go
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow
I can`t wait `til tomorrow
I need you tonight
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow
Why should we wait 'til tomorrow
I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I need you tonight
And I need you tonight
'Cause I need you tonightYou might also likeEmbed
