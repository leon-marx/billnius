Running Back LyricsI'm not gonna fall in love anymore
I don't wanna hear that word anymore, anymore
Easier said than done
Easier said than done
I keep sayin' to myself, "It's only love"
Who needs all that stupid stuff anyway, anyway?
Easier said than done
Easier said than done
I keep runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back for more, for more
I keep runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back for more, for more
Easier said than done
(Easier said than done)
Easier said than done
I keep runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back for more, for more

Runnin' back
(I'm not gonna fall in love anymore)
Runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back for more, for more
Runnin' back
(I don't want to hear that word anymore)
Runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back for more, for more
Runnin' back
(I'm not gonna fall in love anymore)
Runnin' back
Runnin' back
Runnin' back for more, for moreEmbed
