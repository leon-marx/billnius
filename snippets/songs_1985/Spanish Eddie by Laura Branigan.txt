Spanish Eddie LyricsThere was heat in the air
And cops everywhere you looked
There wasn't a lot
So the breaks that you've got, you know you took
And I remember wonderin' where you've been
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' "Desolation Row" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie fell from grace
There was amazement on his face
On the night that Eddie failed, sanity prevailed
It was June or July
When the heat from above beat down
It was famine or drought
When the brothers went out of style uptown
And we was mixin' Vicks with lemon gin
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' "Desolation Row" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie made front page
His revolution came of age
He wrote "surrender" on the wall
The night he took the fall
You might also likeI heard someone say, "He's trying to fly"
Like Eddie used to say, "We'll do when we die"
I know someone turned you for a spin
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' "Desolation Row" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie fell from grace
There was amazement on his face
On the night that Eddie failed, sanity prevailed
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' "Desolation Row" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' "Desolation Row" on the radio
The night Spanish Eddie cashed it in
They were playin' "Desolation Row" on the radioEmbed
