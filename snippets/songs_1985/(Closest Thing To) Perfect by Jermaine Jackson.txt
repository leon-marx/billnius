(Closest Thing To) Perfect LyricsWhoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen
Ooh, she's an ideal lady
That, she's so well-defined
Ooh, she's drivin' me crazy
She's got those long legs streamlined
Look at that anatomy
The sweetest thing
That could ever be
(Heaven knows)
Heaven knows
She was made for me
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen
I can't believe
What I'm feeling
Ooh, I've lost all control
Girl, don't you know
What you're doin'
You got me burnin' up on the inside
You might also likeI can't explain

It must be some kind of chemistry
Heaven knows
It was meant to be
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen
Oh, listen, precious
You are on my mind
I've gotta have some time
Ooh, you're the ideal lady
That, you've got my heart and mind
Girl, you're drivin' me crazy
She's got those long legs streamlined
Look at that anatomy
The sweetest thing
That could ever be
Heaven knows
She was made for me
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen
I can't explain
What she does to me
(I can't explain)
It must be some kind of chemistry
Heaven knows
It was meant to be
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seen
Whoa, oh

Whoa, oh
She's the closest thing
To perfect that I've ever seenEmbed
