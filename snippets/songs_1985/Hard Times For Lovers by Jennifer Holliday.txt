Hard Times for Lovers Lyrics
When you're far away, youre only human
And your love may stray, in another's arms
If we renew our faith, I know we can get through it
And I will stand by you, in love right or wrong

These are hard times, hard times for lovers
People separate, they dont stay together for long
But I know what's real and we got each other
I will stand by you, in love right or wrong

When you're far away, youre only human
And your love may stray, in another's arms
If we renew our faith, we can get through it
I will stand by you, in love right or wrong

How can I expect you to never want another?
Why should I believe youd be the perfect one?
Just don't tell me lies, let's be real with each other
And the truth will make our love strong

When you're far away, youre only human
And your love may stray, in another's arms
If we renew our faith, we can get through it
I will stand by you, in love right or wrong
You might also like
These are hard times, hard times for lovers
These are hard times, hard times for lovers
If we renew our faith, we can get through it
I will stand by you, in love right or wrong
When you're far away, you're only human
People make mistakes, sometimes we're wrong
If we renew our faith, we can get through it
I will stand by you, in love right or wrongEmbed
