Lady Of My Heart LyricsThere's a quiet time
When everyone goes home
And I'm left standing here
On the stage alone
When shadows paint the scene
Where spotlights used to fall
And now it's like a dream
Did it happen after all?
Then I see you there
In silent silhouette
The glow of your cigarette
Is like a shooting star
Lady of my heart
Tell me who you are
You've waited in the dark
And I need you will be with me tonight
Lady, please reveal
If what you are is real
Can I touch? Can I feel?
Just an image of you
I've listened to the cheers
I guess I've heard my share
But I was never sure
Was it you out there?
You might also likeNow I understand
You've always been the one
Who stood out from the crowd
You're my inspiration
So take me by the hand
Before the moment's gone
I'll dance you into the dawn
And dream you into my life
Lady of my heart
Tell me who you are
You've waited in the dark
And I need you will be with me tonight
Lady, please reveal
If what you are is real
Yeah, can I touch? Can I feel?
Are you just a fantasy?
You're the lady of my heart
I know you areEmbed
