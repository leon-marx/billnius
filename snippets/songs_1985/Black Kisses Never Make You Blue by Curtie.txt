Black Kisses (Never Make You Blue) LyricsLike a shot in the heart
Right into your soul
Is a kiss from our lips
Come on, you can get it all
Black kisses never make you blue
My sisters and me
We got some for you
Black kisses never make you blue
We give them for free
We give them to you
We say black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy
Black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy, no, no
Look at my big, dark eyes and my ebony skin
I can say I'm black and I'm proud
No movie star, but a good-looking woman
That's what I am and I say it loud
Yeah, there must be a boy, a special one
And I can say it for the other girls too
When we meet them men, we know it's true
Black kisses never make you blue, boy, no, no

Right into your soul
Is a kiss from our lips
Come on, you can get it all
Black kisses never make you blue
My sisters and me
We got some for you, we say
Black kisses never make you blue
We give them for free
We give them to you
We say black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy, oh, no
Black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy
Do you wanna take a chance?
I can see it on your face
Come on, start it with a dance
Like a shot in the heart
(Like a shot in the heart)
Right into your soul
(Right into your soul)
Is a kiss from our lips
(Is a kiss from our lips)
Come on, you can get it all
(Come on, you can get it all)
Black, black kisses
Black, black kisses
Black kisses never make you blue
My sisters and me
We got some for you, we say
Black kisses never make you blue
We give them for free
We give them to you
Black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boy, no, no
Black, black kisses
Never make you blue, boyEmbed
