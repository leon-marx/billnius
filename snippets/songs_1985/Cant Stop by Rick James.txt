Cant Stop Lyrics
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop
Can't stop, can't stop, can't stop, can't stop

There's something in the air
It's telling me I should beware
(Can't stop, can't stop) Oh yeah
(Can't stop, can't stop) Alright
These multi-city streets
Make it so that you can't miss a beat
(Can't stop, can't stop) Oh yeah
(Can't Stop, can't stop) Alright

I've got to keep my two eyes open today
Look out for someone who might have the urge to play
Maybe go to California with a suitcase in my hand
Get me a suite in Beverly Hills
And have the best of life and thrills, yeah

I can't stop
No, I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up, no
I can't stop
No, I just can't stop it now
I can't stop
Got to keep on rocking and living it up
Ain't never gonna give up

I can't stop, babe
I can't stop, babe

There's something in the air
It's telling me I should beware
(Can't stop, can't stop) Oh yeah
(Can't stop, can't stop) Alright
These multi-city streets
Make it so that you can't miss a beat
(Can't stop, can't stop) Oh yeah
(Can't stop, can't stop) Alright

I've got to keep my two eyes open today
Look out for someone who might have the urge to play
Maybe go to California with a suitcase in my hand
Get me a suite in Beverly Hills
And have the best of life and thrills, yeah
