Sweet, Sweet Baby (Im Falling) LyricsSweet sweet baby mine
I want you 'round me all the time
Cause you know you make my soul sing
And the bells in my heart go chime chime chime
Sweet sweet baby mine
I'm short of breath and full of sighs
Yeah you set my sprit soaring
And you make my lovelight shine shine shine
I'm gracin' the edge
I'm losing my head
I'm fallin'
But I don't mind
You set the fire
Inside my soul
And the heat
Makes it hard to say no
I didn't wanna lose control
But I'm fallin'
Sweet sweet baby mine
I want you round me all the time
Cause you know you make my soul sing
And the bells in my heart go chime chime chime
You might also likeSweet sweet baby mine
If the way I'm feelin' is a crime
Oh honey, then I'm guilty
Cause you got my heart beatin' double time time time
I'm gracin' the edge
I'm losing my head
I'm fallin'
But I don't mindEmbed
