Apollo Medley (Live at the Apollo Theater, Harlem, NY - May 1985) Lyrics
Alright, now comes the special portion of our show. I'd like to bring out a very special and dear friend of mine, one of the original Temptations, Mr. Eddie Kendricks. Yeah!
Part I: Get Ready

I never met a girl who makes me feel the way that you do
(You're alright)
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real, I say that you do
(You're outta sight)

So, fee-fi-fo-fum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come
(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

If you wanna play hide and seek with love, let me remind you
(It's alright)
But the lovin' you're gonna miss and the time it takes to find you
(It's outta sight)
You might also like
So, fiddley-dee, fiddley-dum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come
(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)

If all my friends should want you too, I'll understand it
(Be alright)
I hope I get to you before they do, the way I planned it
(Be outta sight)

So tweedley-dee, tweedley-dum
Look out, baby, 'cause here I come

And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready 'cause here I come
(Get ready 'cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready 'cause here I come)
(Get ready 'cause here I come) You better get ready
(Get ready)
Alright, the next guy we're bringing out right now is no stranger to the Apollo Theater. The voice you know and love, David Ruffin
Part II: Ain't Too Proud To Beg

I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind 'cause you mean that much to me

No, no, no, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Now I've got a love so deep in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come and plead to you, baby
If pleadin' keeps you from walkin' out of that door

No, no, no, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Oh, let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can

No, no, no, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

If I have to sleep on your doorstep all night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Oh, let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I want to keep you any way I can

Ain't too proud to beg, sweet darlin'
Please don't leave (don't leave) me, girl, don't you go
Ain't to proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl, don't you go

Baby, baby, baby, (ooh, sweet darlin')
Oh, no
Don't leave me girl, no, no
If crying keeps you near
I don't mind crying
Don't leave me girl, oh, no
Oh, baby
Don't leave me girl, no
Don't ever leave me
Part III: The Way You Do The Things You Do

You've got a smile so bright
You know you could have been a candle
I'm holding you so tight
You know you could have been a handle
The way you swept me off my feet
You know you could have been a broom
The way you smell so sweet
You know you could have been some perfume

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do

As pretty as you are
You know you could have been a flower
If good looks was a minute
You know that you could be an hour
The way you stole my heart
You know you could have been a cool crook
And baby you're so smart
You know you could have been a schoolbook

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do, the way you do the things you do


You made my life so rich
You know you could have been some money
And baby you're so sweet
You know you could have been some honey

Well, you could have been anything that you wanted to
And I can tell, the way you do the things you do
The way you do the things you do

You really swept me off my feet (The way you do the things you do)
You made my life complete (The way you do the things you do)
You made my life so bright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
You make me feel alright (The way you do the things you do)
Part IV: My Girl

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day
When it's cold outside, I've got the month of May (We can all sing this one)
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

I've got so much honey, the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

My girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl

Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, yeah

I don't need no money baby, fortune, or fame
I've got all the riches, darling, one skinny man can claim
Well, I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?

It's my girl, my girl, my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girl, my girl
(Talkin' 'bout my girl)

I've got sunshine on a cloudy day (Woah, woah)
With my girl
I've even got the month of May
With my girl
Talkin' 'bout my girlEmbed
