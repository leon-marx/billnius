Everything Must Change Lyrics(Everything must change)

I was never one to back out of an argument
And say I was wrong
Even when I`d seen the other side
I`ll hide my foolishness and carry on
But still I`d be embarrassed
Cause they see what happened
And they`d play along
Until I back myself into a corner
I`ll only realize they`re gone

And like a dream a life a reason
Everything must change
(Every, everything must change)
And like the world is open season
Everything must change
(Every, everything must change)

In the same way when we disagree
I wouldn`t the one to back down
Still I know that you had faith in me
Tell me something
Am I letting you down?
You might also likeCause when I woke up
And I saw the note
You press into the mirror frame
Well, it was easy to be angry at you
But deep inside
I know we share the blame

Now Im like a dream a life a reason
Everything must change
(Every, everything must change)
And like the world is open season
Everything must change
(Every, everything must change)

I`m going back to the top to start myself off
But first of all somethings I need to know
When I`m scarred of being wrong again
Won`t you be the one I turn to?
To let me know
Oh, let me know
Oh, ooh
Please let me be right for once
Cause right now all I feel
I do is wrong
And it`s never too late to learn about love
I just need your hand to hold on
Like a dream
A life, a reason
Everything must change
(Every, everything must change)
And like the world is open season
Everything must change
(Every, everything must change)
Oh, they must change
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh
(And like a dream, a life
A reason everything must change)
(Like the world is open season
Everything must change)
Everything must change
(Like a dream
A life, a reason
Everything must change)
(Like the world is open season
Everything must change)
Oh, you know
(Like a dream
A life, a reason
Everything must change)
Oh, yeah, yeahEmbed
