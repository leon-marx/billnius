Vox Humana LyricsEarly morning
Looking tired and worn
Looking out
For the enemy
You made all the
Way to Hudson Bay
But you're right
Back here with me
Trying to run away
(Where you running, my baby)
Your lips are sealed, a runaway
(Where you running, my baby)
Tell me, baby
What you want me to do
Giving my love for you
(Mama, don't you know)
Now you're living
Like a runaway
Sunday dawn
You met a gypsy woman
On a road to Tennessee
She told you a lot
About the world to come
But did she tell you
Why you couldn't tell me
You might also likeLike a runaway
(Where you running, my baby)
How one by one, you run away
(Where you running, my baby)
Tell me, baby
What you wanted me to do
Giving my love to you
(Mama, don't you know)
It's gonna be
A hard leaving
You're gonna need
A strong reason
'Cause I ain't
Gonna start believing
That you're out of my life
You bet you better
Do your fast talking
Before you do
Your last walking
It's gonna be
A hard, hard leaving
(Talk to me)
Vox humana
Sounds just like
Your voice to me
Vox humana
I wanna feel the
Power of speech
Vox humana
Sounds so right
So real to me
Vox humana
You gotta say
What you oughta say
Don't try to run away
Darling, I'm letting you know
Gonna be
A hard leaving
You're gonna need
A strong reason
'Cause I ain't
Gonna start believing
That you're out of my life
You bet you better
Do your fast talking
Before you do
Your last walking
It's gonna be
A hard, hard leaving
A hard leaving
You're gonna need
A strong reason
'Cause I ain't
Gonna start believing
That you're out of my life
You bet you better
Do your fast talking
Before you do
Your last walking
A hard, hard, woo
Hard leaving
You're gonna need
A strong reason
'Cause I ain't
Gonna start believing
You're walking out
Of my life
You bet you better
Do your fast talking
Before you do
Your last walking
Gonna make it hard
Hard leaving
Vox humana
Sounds just like
Your voice to me
