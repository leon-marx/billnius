The Heart Is Not So Smart LyricsYou know that she is just a heartbreak in disguise
You know that fallin' for the girl is not so wise
But every time your mind wants you to stay away
Your heart just looks the other way
Oh... Oh... She's all that you want now
Oh... Oh... She's nothin' you need
No... Oh... But there you go
Blame it all on love, you know you should know better
But the heart is not so smart
Can't always trust it, no
The heart is not so smart
Goes where it should not go
Always seems to find
It's way to trouble, no
The heart is not so smart
Oh, no, oh, no
The heart's been broken, it's been bruised and it's been burned
So after that you think a lesson might be learned
But it keeps falling for the same lines every time
Sometimes the heart can be so blind
Oh... Oh... And when you discover
Oh... Oh... She's tellin' you lies
Oh... Oh... Well, don't you know
That the heart is always last to realize
