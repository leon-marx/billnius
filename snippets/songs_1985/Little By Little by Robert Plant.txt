Little by Little LyricsLittle by little, my heart grieves
Little by little, I'll call your name
Little by little, my tears fall
Little by little, everything changes
Little by little, the time goes
Little by little, the days pass by
Little by little, the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again now
I can breathe again
Back at the mirror, your good friend
Talkin' to the mirror to play out your game
Stop in the middle, I stop then
Look at the winner and the price you pay
Cold was the winter, I tremble
Long was the fall that had no end
Now little by little, the air clears
Little by little, I can breathe, I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again now
Call your name, call your name
Call your name, call your name
Everything changes, everything changes
I call your name
You might also likeOh, I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
I can breathe again
Oooh, oooh
