Not Enough Love in the World Lyrics
Sometimes I wonder where it is love goes
I don't know if even Heaven knows
I know you had some dreams that didn't quite come true
And now I'm not the one, little girl, who's keeping you

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying, I could not make it right
For you, girl
There's just not enough love in the world

I know people hurt you so bad
They don't know the damage they can do, and it makes me so sad
How we knock each other down just like children on a playground
Even after that old sun went down

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying, I could not make it right
For you, girl
There's just not enough love in the world

Oh darlin', this is still a shady little town
And sometimes it's so hard to smile
For the world, for the camera, and still have something left
You don't have to prove nothin' to nobody, just take good care of yourself
You might also like
I'm not easy to live with, I know that it's true
You're no picnic either, babe, that's one of the things I loved about you
But the time will come around when we need to settle down
Got to get off this merry-go-round

I was either standing in your shadow or blocking your light
Though I kept on trying, I could not make it right
For you, girl
There's just not enough love in the world

For you, girl, oh girl
There's just not enough love in the world
Not enough love in the world
In the world
In the world
In the worldEmbed
