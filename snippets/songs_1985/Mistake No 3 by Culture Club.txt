Mistake No. 3 LyricsDa, da, da, da, da, da, doo, doo, doo, doo
Da, da, da, da, da, doo, doo
You can't bystand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow
Into strange and pretty faces I don't know
Clutching to my lipstick traces
Watch them go
And make mistake number three, yeah
(Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three.  (Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three, yeah.  (Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three.  (Mistake number three)
It's strange how much it changes how they want to know
How cynical are people
That's where children go
Dragged into a conversation they can't hold
It's so sad, but it prepares them for the mold
And make mistake number three, yeah
(Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three.  (Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three, yeah.  (Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three.  (Mistake number three)

And why is my love such a struggle with life?
You can't bystand all the people
Stand them on their own
They will fall to pieces
So we watch them grow
And make mistake number three, yeah
(Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three.  (Mistake number three)
Make mistake number three, yeah, yeah

Making mistakes
Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh, yeah.  (Mistake number three)
Mistake number three, yeah, yeah, yeah

Mistakes you make, mistakes you make
Mistakes you make with me.  (Mistake number three)
