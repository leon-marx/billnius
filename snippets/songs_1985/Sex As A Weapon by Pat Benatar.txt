Sex as a Weapon LyricsYou really do know how to strut that stuff (strut that stuff)
You really do know how to act tough (act tough)
Your body's just like a centerfold
A fantasy (a fantasy), anyone would want to hold
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon
You know you're already my obsession
Stop (stop) using sex as a weapon
Love is more than a one way reflection
Stop (stop) using sex as a weapon
With looks that kill and a mind that's twisted (twisted)
I don't know why I can't resist it (resist it)
I tell myself look the other way (other way)
When you want me to (when you want me to)
I, I always stay
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon
You know you're already my obsession
Stop (stop) using sex as a weapon
Love is more than a one way reflection
Stop (stop) using sex as a weapon
You play with desire like it was a toy (toy)
How much affection can you destroy?
You wrap my heart around your little finger
Sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex as a weapon

Stop using sex
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon
You know you're already my obsession
Stop (stop) using sex as a weapon
Love is more than a one way reflection
Stop (stop) using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex
Stop using sex as a weapon
Stop using sex (stop using sex, stop using sex)
Sex as a weapon, as a weaponEmbed
