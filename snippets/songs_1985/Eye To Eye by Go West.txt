Eye To Eye LyricsMaybe it's the wrong time
But when is the right time to say I lied?
I've been keeping secrets
Could this be the last time we say goodbye?
(Here we are)
Eye to eye, no conversation
You know what I'm going to say
Eye to eye, it's a sad situation
Girl, have I thrown it away ?
I was missing you, missing you
I needed someone to comfort me
When you closed the door, baby
How could I know that I still had the key ?
Your love, never thought that I would lose it
My love, won't you tell me what it takes to prove it?
All I want is your love
It's all up to you, girl
I just couldn't keep it to myself
She was nothing to me
And you know in your heart
I don't want anyone elseYou might also likeEmbed
