TranslationsEnglishIn and Out of Love Lyrics
In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love

Young and wired
Set to explode in the heat
You won't tire
Because baby was born with the beat
Take you higher than you've ever known
Then drive you down to your knees
I'll pick you up when you've had enough
You been burned baby lessons learned

(In and out of love)
Hear what I'm saying
(In and out of love)
It's the way that we're playing
(In and out of love)
Too much is never enough
She's going to get you
You might also like
Running wild
When me and my boys hit the streets
Right on time
She's here to make my night complete
Then I'm long gone I got another show
One more town, one mile to go
One endless night of fantasy
Is all she left of her with me

(In and out of love)
Hear what I'm saying
(In and out of love)
It's the way that we're playing
(In and out of love)
When we're together
(In and out of love)
It's too much forever
(In and out of love)
Hear what I'm saying
(In and out of love)
It's the way that we're playing
(In and out of love)
Too much is never enough
She's going to get you

Out of love
Out of love
Out of love
Out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love
Love
(In and out of love)
In and out of love
In and out of love
In and out of love
You want me too meet you, what?
(In and out of love)
Your daddy is who?
(In and out of love)Embed
