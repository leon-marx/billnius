Beats So Lonely LyricsBeat's so lonely
I bet it's lonely at the top
She hesitates
But the beat will never stop
Wanting him only
But the people never see
Her heart burning
That's the secret that she keeps
Come on baby
You know there's something missing
Don't find nothing
No more coincidences
Pretty baby
Look in his eyes and you will see
Things will happen
But only if they're meant to be
Beat's so lonely
I bet it's lonely at the top
So lonely at the top
So lonely
She said
Beat's so lonely
If you let it be that way
She can't tell the difference anyway
You might also likeShe thinks hold me
But she's scared to say
She paid dearly for the answers of her days
Answers of her
Answers of her days
Beat's so lonely
As she waits so patiently
Her heart's yearning
How she'd love him to see
He's not hurting
But he wouldn't mind to be
She still sees him
She sees him interestingly
Come on baby
You know there's something missing
Don't find nothing
No more coincidences
Pretty baby
Before you give him all you got
Got to come closer
You got to give it one more shot
Beat's so lonely
I bet she's lonely at the top
So lonely at the top
So lonely
She said
Beat's so lonely
If you let it be that way
She can't tell the difference anyway
She thinks hold me
But she's scared to say
She paid dearly for the answers of her days
Answers of her days
Answers of her days
So lonely (x8)
Come on baby
You know there's something missing
Don't find nothing
No more coincidences
Pretty baby
Before you give him all you got
You got to come closer
You got to give it one more shot
Beat's so lonely
I bet she's lonely at the top
So lonely at the top
So lonely
So lonely (x10)Embed
