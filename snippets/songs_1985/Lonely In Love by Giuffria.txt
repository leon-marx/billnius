Lonely In Love LyricsDon't take it so hard with your broken heart
Don't cry yourself to sleep tonight
It's a lonely world, a lonely world. So hold on
Don't take it so hard, find someone new
It's happened to me, it can happen to you
It's nothing more than a changing tide. So hold on
You shoot from the heart and play by the rules
It's easy to live, there's no way to lose
Till a change of heart leaves you alone
You can't go on
Now you're lonely in love. Alone tonight
Yea, you're lonely in love and it don't feel right
But you can't walk away with love on the line
You still hold on
I told you before, I'll tell you again
Don't take it so hard with your broken heart
Don't cry yourself to sleep tonight
It's a lonely world, a lonely world. So hold on
Don't take it so hard. Don't take it so hard
It's a lonely world. So hold onYou might also likeEmbed
