Understanding Lyrics
It seems like only yesterday
I didn't have a clue
I stood alone not knowin' where to turn
Now suddenly I look around
And everything looks new
I don't know why, but I think I'm startin' to learn

They call it understanding (-standing)
A willingness to grow
I'm finally understanding (-standing)
There's so much I can know

Until the day you came along
I used to just get lost
I only heard the things I wanted to hear
It always seemed like no one cared
But then you took the time
And now I look and everything seems clear

You've got me understanding (-standing)
You've really helped me see
I'm finally understanding (-standing)
It's meant so much to me
You've got me understanding (-standing)
You've given me some pride
I'm finally understanding (-standing)
You're really on my side
You're really on my side (Yeah, yeah, ooh)
Got me understanding
You might also like
Understanding
(You've got me understanding)
Mmm yeah, understanding, understanding
You've got me understanding
For the first time
You've got me understanding (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
You've got me understanding
You've got me understandingEmbed
