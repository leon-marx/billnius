One Foot Back in Your Door LyricsAll right
It's like a bug, it's everywhere
Just like a fever, it's in your head
So don't be faithless, don't be blind
Stop standing there, stop wastin' time
I'm a non-stop miracle, I'm your man
Touch me, baby, any way you can
I got one foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
I got one foot back in your door, baby
All I need is some lovin', lovin', lovin'
Twinkle your star like you do
I've seen that movie, you've seen it too
I give you rhythm, perfect time
If you wanna fly, then so do I
I'm a non-stop miracle, I'm your man
Squeeze me, baby, any way you can
I got one foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
I got one foot back in your door, baby
All I need is some lovin', lovin', lovin'
You might also likeI got my motives, I got my plans
I got the power, it's in my hands
My senses swimmin', divin' for pearls
Callin' all women, callin' all girls
I'm king of fashion, I bring the news
One in a million, I'm a must for you
So don't be faithless, don't be blind
I'm a non-stop miracle, I'm your man
(Non-stop miracle, I'm your man)
Touch me, baby
Touch me, baby
I got one foot back in the door
One foot back on the floor
(I'm in, baby)
I'm back in your door
I'm back
All right
I got one foot back in your door
One foot back on the floor
(I'm coming back)
One foot back in your door, baby
I'm back in your door
One foot back on the floor
I got one foot back in your door, baby
(I'm back in the door)
One foot back in the door
(I'm back on the floor)
One foot back on the floor
I got one foot back in your door, baby
(I'm back in your door)
One foot back in the door
(I'm back in the door)Embed
