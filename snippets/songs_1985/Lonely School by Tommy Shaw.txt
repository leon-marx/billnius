Lonely School LyricsI drove past where we used to live
You might have caught a glimpse of me
As I passed by
I swear it's still hard to believe
But at the time it seemed so clear to me
I thought I had it all worded out
I packed all that was dear to me
And I left without a doubt that I'd
Given it all I had to give
Still nothing moved nothing changed
Nothing lived
I did everything that I could do
But now I've had time to sort it out
To graduate from lonely school
And now I've got to let you know
It's me who was the fool
It was me baby I was wrong
But how can I say it
You must have known it all along
It was you who was always strong
And I've got to tell you now
I've got to show you how I've
You might also likeChanged so many of my ways
I left the band, steadied my hand and learned a trade
And I'm coming back this time to stay
And you won't recognize the boy
Who graduated lonely school
'Cause I've become quite wise about
Who was or not the fool
It was me baby I was wrong
But how can I say it
You must have known it all along
It was you who was always strong
And I've got to tell you now
I've got to show you how I've...Embed
