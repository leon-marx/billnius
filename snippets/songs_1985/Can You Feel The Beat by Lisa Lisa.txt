Can You Feel the Beat Lyrics
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through dark?

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart?
That beat in my heart

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ahh (My baby)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ahh

After all that we've been through
I can't seem to face the fact that, boy, I'm losing you
I threw away all ties with those venetian blinds
I looked and saw my heart just overrule my mind
And I've tried not to let it show
Now I don't know what to do, told myself I'm lying
So let's not just let it go
My heart does double beats for you, ooh

Now you know my love won't come close
All this love will turn to gold if we stay in love, all my love
My love, my love
You might also like
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart?
That beat in my heart
That beat

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ahh (My baby, baby)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ahh

It's like trying to touch the sky but overlook the sun
That's why reality keeps telling me that you're the one
Just the very thought of you gets me aroused
I can feel my heartbeat cry through my blouse (Yeah)
And darling, I've tried not to show
Now I don't know what to do, told myself that I'm dying
So let's not just let it go
My heart does double beats for you, baby
And I hope you feel the same
'Cause I do know for sure, baby
That sure as my name
Oh, baby, I know that you're the cure
Now you know my love won't come close
All this love will turn to gold if we stay in love, all my love
My love, my love

Can you feel the beat within my heart?
Can't you see my love shine through dark?
Can you feel the beat within my heart
Can't you see my love shine through dark?
Can't you see that you must be a part
Of that beat in my heart?
That beat in my heart
That beat

Th-th-th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-th-th-that-that beat
Th-th-th-th-that-that beat
That-that-that beat
Th-th-that-that beat
That-that-that beat
Can you feel the beat? Can-Can-Can-Can-Can
Can you feel Can you feel Can
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat? Can-Can-Can-Can you
Can you feel the Can-Can you feel the
Can-Can-Can-Can-Can you feel Can you feel
Can you feel that beat?
That beat
How can I believe when you say you need and miss my tender care
But I do myself stay up at night, thinkin' that you're still there
Well, maybe this time without my mind, I'll let my heart be the key
Now what I wanna do is just ask you, tell me, can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat?
Well, can you feel the beat?
Can you feel the beat? Talk to me

Now you know my love won't come close
All this love will turn to gold if we stay in love, all my love
My love, my love

With every beat of my heart, every beat of my heart, yeah
All my love
With every beat of my heart, every beat of my heart
And love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love
Don't stop, one more time
You know my love won't come close
All this love will turn to gold if we stay in love, all my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my love
My love, my loveEmbed
