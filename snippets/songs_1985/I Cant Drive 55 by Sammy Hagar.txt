I Cant Drive 55 Lyrics
One foot on the brake and one on the gas, hey
Well, there's too much traffic, I can't pass, no
So I tried my best illegal move
A big black and white come and crushed my groove again

Go on and write me up for 125
Post my face, wanted dead or alive
Take my license, all that jive
I can't drive 55
Oh no, uh

So I signed my name on number 24, hey
Yeah, the judge said, "Boy, just one more, huh
I'm gonna throw your ass in the city joint"
Looked me in the eye, said, "You get my point?"
I say, "Yeah, oh yeah"

Write me up for 125
Post my face, wanted dead or alive
Take my license, all that jive
I can't drive 55, oh yeah

I can't drive 55
I can't drive 55
I can't drive 55
I can't drive 55

When I drive that slow, you know it's hard to steer
And I can't get my car out of second gear
What used to take two hours now takes all day
Huh, it took me sixteen hours to get to L.A

Go on and write me up for 125
Post my face, wanted dead or alive
Take my license, all that jive
I can't drive 55

No, no, no, I can't drive (I can't drive 55)
I can't drive (I can't drive 55)
(I can't drive 55)
(I can't drive 55)1Embed
