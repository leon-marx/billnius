(Come On) Shout LyricsWatch out for the candy rapper
The boy can dance
And he's so sweet, yeah
He'll blow your composure
As he picks you right
Out of your seat
He's got you going in circles
Your head is spinning round and round
You'll start to feel his motion
When he takes you on down

Shout, break out
Don't be insecure
Cause it's your chance to scream
Shout, break out
Go dance with her
Cause she's a physical dream
Oh, yeah
Shout, break out
From the way you were
Cause it's your chance to dream
(Come on) shout
Freak out
Be good to her
Cause she's a human machine, oh, oh

As my feet dance on a dime
Yeah, I need the music to take me
To a place in another time
I wanna be your lover
And feel it as we move tonight
No keeping it under cover
Can't stop until we see the light
Shout, break out
Don't be insecure
Cause it's your chance to scream
Shout, break out
Go dance with her
Cause she's a physical dream
Oh, yeah
Shout, break out
From the way you were
Cause it's your chance to dream
(Come on) shout
Freak out
Be good to her
Cause she's a human machine, oh, oh
Ooh, when I'm with you
I feel a little heaven
You got that something
I wanna get in
We're two stars
That shine so bright
We'll dance better
Than we dance tonight
Shout, shout
Ohh
Shout, break out
Don't be insecure
Cause it's your chance to scream
Shout, break out
Go dance with her
Cause she's a physical dream
Oh, yeah
Shout, break out
From the way you were
Cause it's your chance to dream
(Come on) shout
Freak out
Be good to her
Cause she's a human machine, oh, oh
Shout, break out
Don't be insecure
Cause it's your chance to scream
Shout, break out
Go dance with her
Cause she's a physical dream
Oh, yeah
