One in a million LyricsI'm getting ready
Anticipating that she's the one
She's the one, she's the one I can't keep waiting
She's the one, with a star of her own
Well let me tell you, she's one in a million
She gets to me like no one
You know how much I miss her, standing alone

That's how I know she's the one, one in a million
So different from the other ones
She's the one, one in a million
Nothing going to break it, just too strong
Just too strong
She said she's getting, tired of losing
She said her heart's seen one too many bruising
She said it's time something good has come along
Yes she says, I'm one in a million
She's got so much to give me
Makes me right, everything goes on

I'm getting ready
Anticipating that she's the one
She's the one, she's the one I can't keep waiting
She's the one, with a star of her own
