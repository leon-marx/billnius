Fools Like Me LyricsThere's a place I belong
Call  it here Call it home
Let  the silence take me away
Send me back to you again
There's a dream I dreamed before
Always  shine forever more
Let  the memory show the way
I am here with you again
I'm  the one who let you go
First to leave the last to know
I could wish you back to me
Dreams are made for fools like me
The  the new in when I'm over
All the tears a little wiser
I'll be here
Cause I'm the one who let you go
First to leave the last to know
I could wish you back to me
Dreams are made for fools like meYou might also likeEmbed
