After the Fire LyricsAfter the fire, the fire still burns
The heart grows older
But never, ever learns
The memories smolder
And the soul always yearns
After the fire, the fire still burns
I heard a voice asking
What happens after the fire
And then the sound of a
Breaking window and
The scream of a tire
And then the sound of a distant gun
And the cry of a hungry child
The night is hot but nothing's
Gonna stop this gang going wild
After the fire, the fire still burns
The heart grows older
But never, ever learns
The memories smolder
But the soul always yearns
After the fire, the fire still burns
I saw Matt Dillon in black and white
There ain't no color in memories
He rode his brother's Harley across the TV
While I was laughing at Dom DeLuise
Now I'm cycling all my video tapes
I'm crying and I'm joking
I've gotta stop drinking
I've gotta stop thinking
I've gotta stop smoking

The heart grows older
But never, ever learns
The memories smolder
And the soul always yearns
After the fire, the fire still burns
Raging through the pain
Blackening the promises
The tears and the rain
The fire still burn
'Til the wind begins to turn
And it all begins again
After the fire, the fire still burns
The heart grows older
But never, ever learns
The memories smolder
And the soul always yearns
After the fire, the fire still burns
The fire still burns
After the fire, the fire still burns
The heart grows older
But never, ever learns
The memories smolder
And the soul always yearns
After the fire, the fire still burns
After the fire, the fire still burns
After the fire, the fire still burns1Embed
