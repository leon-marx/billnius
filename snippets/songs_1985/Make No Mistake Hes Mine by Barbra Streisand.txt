Make No Mistake, Hes Mine LyricsDon't call him up anymore
Cause I don't wanna hear your voice
I don' t wanna see your face
Answer his door
Make no mistake he's mine he's mine, he's mine
He only knows how I feel
I only know what he's like
When he needs me
Oh how he needs me
Deep in the night
Make no mistake
He's mine, he's mine, he's mine
Don't get to close when you dance
Cause I don't wanna hear from my friends
You were out on the town
There in his arms ( there in his arms)
There in his arms ( there in his arms)
Don't include him in you dreams ( I wanna be in his dreams)
Cause I don't wanna close my eyes (my eyes)
I don't wanna know where he goes
Each might when he leaves ( leaves)
Make no mistake (make no mistake)
He's mine (he's mine) he's mine ( he's mine)
He is mine...
