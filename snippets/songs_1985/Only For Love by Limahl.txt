Only for Love LyricsIf that's your problem don't let it show
You will find itself deceiving love can be unsure
Keep a level head maintain your pride
Then you can face the situation straight in the eye
And especially when she comes on strong
When she smiles that smile that leads you on
Try to see it through playing out your part
Making certain when you give your heart it's
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love
Love was never planned ever before
Some have spent their whole life searching cold and insecure
But as suddenly as that love will arrive
And you'll recognize the feeling ooh you're on fire
And especially as she moves in close
When she moves that move there's no suppose
You'll find you're hunting when you're apart
But when you give your heart it's
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love
When you give your heart it should be
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love
Only for love
Only for loveYou might also likeEmbed
