Information LyricsI'm still tracin' over lines
That you used on me, yeah
I should forget
But I can't shake the memory
In the dead of night
Dreams come alive
How you left me alone
And you pushed me aside
Nothin' I could do to try to make you see
Make up your mind, yeah
Make up your mind
Baby, my heart is pumpin' for information
Plan your moves on me
Somewhere, somehow, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean to me
I tracked you down like a hunter
Breakin' you undr my spell
Blastin' like thunder
Callin' out your nam
In the heat of night
Dreams come alive
How you left me alone
And pushed me aside
Nothin' I could do to try to make you see
Make up your mind, yeah
Make up your mind

Plan your moves on me
Somewhere, somehow, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean to me
In the heat of the night
Dreams come alive
How you left me alone
And pushed me aside
Nothin' I could do
To try to make you see
Make up your mind
Make up your mind
Baby, my heart is pumpin' for information
Did you plan your moves on me?
Somewhere, somehow, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean, what you do
What you're doin'
My heart is pumpin' for information
Plan your moves on me, yeah
Somewhere, somehow, some time
You're gonna realize
Just what you mean, what you do
What you do
My heart is pumpin' for information
You plan your moves on meEmbed
