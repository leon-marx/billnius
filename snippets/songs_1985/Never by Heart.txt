Never Lyrics
Ooh-hoo, oh, yeah, yeah
Whoa-oh-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh
Whoa-oh-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh, whoa-ooh

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you, stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never choose, even if you try, yeah
You're banging your head again 'cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love, your chance to let me know

We can't go on, just running away
If we stay any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down

Never
Never
Never
Never run away

Hey baby, you know it's true, why you bother lying?
When you know that, that you want it too, don't you dare deny me
Now walk those legs right over here, give me what I'm dying for
One chance, one love, hold me down, never let me go
You might also like
We can't go on, just running away
If we wait any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, anything you want, we can make it happen
Stand up and turn around, never let them shoot us down

Never (Oh)
Never (No!)
Never
Never run away

Never (No, never!)
Never
Never (No, no, no, no)
Never run away

Hey baby, I'm talkin' to you, stop yourself and listen
Some things you can never, never choose, even if you try, yeah
You're banging your head again, 'cause somebody won't let you in
One chance, one love, your chance to let me know

We can't go on, just running away
If we stay any longer, we will surely never get away
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, never
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, never
We can't go on, never
We can't go on, never
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, n-n-n-never
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, Never, never, never
We can't go on, we can't go on, we can't go on, never
We can't go on, we can't go on, we can't go on, never
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, n-n-n-never, never
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, never, never, never, never1Embed
