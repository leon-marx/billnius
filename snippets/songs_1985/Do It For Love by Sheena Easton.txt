Do It for Love LyricsDo you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
Do you feel the same connection
Make it right some way some how
Does it come from your emotions?
Open up the door a little wider now
Do you try to find the feeling
That should never go away?
Can it really be so easy
Just to make the feeling stay
But when you hold me tight
Oh, I know why you're doing it
Cause love can't be denied
When you prove it
Do it for love
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
(C'mon and prove it for love)
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
You might also likeWhen you promise it's the real thing
Promises that stay the same
Is it really love that you're feeling?
Or just another pleasure you can't explain?
Lift the lid from your emotions
Does it matter what they say
Will you follow your own footsteps?
Baby, let your heartbeat show you the way
But when you hold me tight
Oh, I know why you're doing it
Cause love can't be denied
When you prove it
Do it for love
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
C'mon and prove it for love
When you do me
When you hold me
When you fool me
When you do it
Do it, do it
Come on and do it
Do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?
Do you, do you, do you, do you
Do you do it for love?Embed
