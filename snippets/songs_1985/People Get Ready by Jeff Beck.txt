People Get Ready Lyrics
People get ready, there's a train a-coming
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket, you just thank the Lord

People get ready for the train to Jordan
Picking up passengers from coast to coast
Faith is the key, open the doors and board 'em
There's room for all among the loved the most


There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who would hurt all mankind just to save his own
Have pity on those whose chances are thinner
'Cause there's no hiding place from the Kingdom's throne

So people get ready for the train a-coming
You don't need no baggage, you just get on board
All you need is faith to hear the diesels humming
Don't need no ticket, you just, you just thank the Lord

Yeah, wooo!
Yeah

I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready
This time I'm ready
This time I'm readyEmbed
