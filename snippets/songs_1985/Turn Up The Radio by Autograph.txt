Turn Up The Radio Lyrics
Ooh yeah
Turn it up
Come on

I'm working hard, you're working too
We do it every day
For every minute I have to work
I need a minute of play

Day in, day out, all week long
Things go better with rock
The only time I turn it down
Is when I'm sleepin' it off

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimme some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to gimmie some more

Now listen
I wanna shake, I wanna dance
So count it of one, two, three
I hear the beat, I'm in a trance
No better place to be
You might also like
Daytime, nighttime, anytime
Things go better with rock
I'm goin' twenty four hours a day
I can't seem to stop

Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimme some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to gimmie some more


Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimme some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimme some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to gimmie some more
Turn up the radio
I need the music, gimme some more
Turn up the radio
I wanna feel it, got to gimmie some more1Embed
