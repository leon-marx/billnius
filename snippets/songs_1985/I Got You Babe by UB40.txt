I Got You Babe Lyrics
They say we're young and we don't know
Won't find out until we grow
Well I don't know if baby that's true
Cause you've got me baby, I've got you

Babe, I've got you babe
I've got you, babe

They say our love won't pay the rent
Before it's earned our money's always spent
I guess that's so, we don't have a lot
At least I'm sure we've all the things we've got

Babe, I've got you babe
I've got you, babe

I got flowers in the spring
I got you to wear my ring
And when I'm sad, you're around
And when I get scared you're always around
So let them say your hair's too long
I don't care, with you I can't go wrong
Then put your little hand in mine
There ain't no hill or mountain we can't climb
You might also like
Babe, I've got you babe
I've got you, babe
I've got you, babe

I got you to hold my hand
I got you to understand
I got you to walk with me
I got you to talk with me
I got you to kiss goodnight
I got you to hold me tight
I got you and I won't let go
I got you to love me so

I got you, babeEmbed
