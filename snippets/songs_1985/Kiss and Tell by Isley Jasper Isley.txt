Kiss and Tell LyricsTell a story, make it sound provocative
Just a little more spice to a secret that you'll give
Don't you talk to anyone, it's understood
Oh baby, well, it's just too bad if it's just too good
Well, I need you to know (I need you, need you to know)
There's someplace you can go (Can go)
I want you to see (Want you to see)
That you can put your confidence in me
(You better put your confidence in me)
And baby, you might as well
If you're gonna kiss and tell
Baby, you might as well
If you're gonna kiss and tell
(Kiss and tell)
People follow you everywhere you go
But they only wanna use you for what you know
Every face is gonna smile like it's alright
Better brace yourself for a bumpy night
Well, I need you to know (I need you, need you to know)
There's someplace you can go (Can go)
I want you to see (Want you to see)
That you can put your confidence in me
(You better put your confidence in me)
You might also likeAnd baby, you might as well
If you're gonna kiss and tell
Baby, you might as well
If you're gonna kiss and tell
(Kiss and tell)
Well, I need you to know (I need you, need you to know)
There's someplace you can go (Can go)
I want you to see (Want you to see)
That you can put your confidence in me
(You better put your confidence in me)
And baby, you might as well
If you're gonna kiss and tell
Baby, you might as well
If you're gonna kiss and tell
(Kiss and tell)
(Kiss and tell)
(Kiss and tell)
