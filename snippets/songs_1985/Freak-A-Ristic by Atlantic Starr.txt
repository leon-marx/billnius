Freak-A-Ristic LyricsShe's hot, she's freak-a-ristic
Last night when I walked into the joint
Everyone felt the sweat, oh, so wet
Walked into the crowd, lunged in with the freaks
Everyone doing the dance, I even saw the freak of the week
She was wearing those red shoes, everybody replied, "She's hot"
And as she riddled to the rhythm of a beat, everybody fell apart, woah
All of a sudden, she turned her head, eyes full of flame
I was hypnotized, mesmerized, I didn't even know my name
Well, well, well, and she was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's freak-a-ristic, hot
She took me by the hand, led me to the back
Almost had a heart attack
She took me to a dark space in her place
We kinda made it our own space
Then she grabbed me around my neck and pulled my head to hers
That's when I felt my blood pressure surges and blown
Take this fancy home where we'll never be all alone
And turn it out 'cause you're freak-a-ristic
You might also likeShe was the finest thing I had ever seen
Fresh as she could be, freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak, brilliant thing
She's freak-a-ristic, she's a freak-a-ristic thing
She's freak-a-ristic
Hypnotized me, mesmerized me
She's freak-a-ristic
Love the way she moves
She's just the finest thing
I had ever seen, fresh as she could be
Freaky lovely thing, turned on me
She's freak-a-ristic
Ooh, she's fresh, she's fine
She's freak-a-ristic
Cannot get her off my mind
She's freak-a-ristic
Sweet tender thing, tender thing
She's freak-a-ristic
She's hot, yeah, she's a freak
Yeah, she's freak-a-ristic
Oops, she's the freaky
Freak of the freaky land
She's freak-a-ristic
Getting her off my mind
She's freak-a-ristic
Freak of the week
Freak of the week
She's freak-a-ristic
She's hot, oh hot
She's a freak, hot
She's a freak to me
She's freak-a-ristic
