Shock LyricsEscaping the anger
For one minute more
This time it's gone way too far
Desperate stranger
He frightens me so
His hold's too tight
Won't let go
I scream long and hard
Won't somebody help me?
I scream out the words
Nobody can hear
I'm in shock
Got no feeling
I'm in shock
It's like I'm dreaming
I'm in shock
Ooh, stop the shock
Motionless movement
Now everything spins
Tortured by time
It begins
My mind is aching
All memories blurred
Madness gives way
I give in
You might also likePain seems far away
No one, we're just watching
Daydreams interfere
I'm not really here
I'm in shock
Got no feeling
I'm in shock
It's like I'm dreaming
I'm in shock
Ooh, stop the shock
Fear slides away
I hear only one sound
My heart beats so loud
I can't think
I search your eyes
I see nothing but hate
I start to fade
Now I'm falling deep into shock
Tomorrow is hopeless
Impossible dream
Exhausted, I lie here and wait
Strength has all left me
My heart feels weak
Miles away, someone speaks
I scream
Pray they hear
Won't somebody help me?
I scream
Someone's near
Get me out of here
I'm in shock
Got no feeling
I'm in shock
It's like I'm dreaming
I'm in shock
Ooh, stop the shock
I'm in shock
Can't stop shaking
I'm in shock
I just can't take it
I'm in shock
Ooh, stop the shockEmbed
