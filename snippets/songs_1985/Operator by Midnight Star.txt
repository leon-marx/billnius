Operator Lyrics
Will someone please hang that phone up?

We're sorry
You must first dial a one when calling this number

Operator
Operate that body, operate on me
Operate that body, take control of me
Operate that body, operate on me
Take control of that body, take control of me

I call my baby up on the telephone
I got connected to a freaky zone
The conversation was strictly zoid
Said if you don't join the party, go home
The operator said this was no mistake
I been connecting every move you make
I hope you're ready to think right
I'm gonna operate my love tonight

Operator, this is an emergency
Operator, baby, don't hang up on me
Operator, this is an emergency
Operator
You might also like
Operate that body, operate on me
Operate that body, take control of me
Operate that body, operate on me
Take control of that body, take control of me

Person to person is how it's got to be
Just one on one, baby, you and me
Computer freaking all night long
And you can bet that all my circuits are strong
Just call me up whenever you find the time
We'll get together on the party line
Let's take our time and do it right
We're gonna operate our love tonight

Operator, this is an emergency
Operator, baby don't hang up on me
Operator, this is an emergency
Operator

Call me up at any time, any time
I'm all in the mix because it's
Party time, I'm gonna take my time
Gonna do it right, do it right
I'm gonna operate your love tonight
Operator, this is an emergency
Operator, baby, don't hang up on me
Operator, this is an emergency
Operator, operator

"Operator, can I help you?"
"Yes, I'm trying to, uh, reach my baby
And I dialed six one six"
"Hey, sir, could you speak up
A little louder because
I can just barely hear you"

Call me up at any time, any time
I'm all in the mix because it's
Party time, I'm gonna take my time
Gonna do it right, do it right
I'm gonna operate your love tonight

Operator, this is an emergency
Operator, baby, don't hang up on me
Operator, this is an emergency
Operator, operator
Operate that body, operate on me
Operate that body, take control of me
Operate that body, operate on me
Take control of that body, take control of me

Operator was busy at the time
She told me, "Hold, please, on the telephone line"
I told her, "Hurry up, 'cause I ain't got much time
It's an emergency, I spent my last dime
I need a, I need a, I need a"

Operator, this is an emergency
Operator, baby, don't hang on me
Operator, this is an emergency
