Love Light in Flight Lyrics
Make me feel like paradise
Give me what I'm missing
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away
I've tasted love so many times
With something always missing
But I know that you got the kind
To take me up and away
I know that our journey
Will be filled with passion, love and pleasure
Touching down where only
Satisfactions guaranteed
We won't let our feelings
Auto-pilot perfect navigation
Sending us to love bliss
Like no one ever knew could be
Oh, make me feel like paradise
Fill me with your kisses
Make the moment feel just right
Take me up and away
Because I have waited all my life (Flying high)
For the one worth giving (Love sky high)
And I don't have to think twice (Flying high)
Let's go up and away
