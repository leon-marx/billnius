Meeting in the Ladies Room Lyrics
I had to leave my condo to come to this
Well, I'm back, but this time I'm with my man
And these women are putting their hands
All over his Yamamoto Kanzai sweater that I bought
And I'm much, much unhappy about that
I'd hate to come down to their level
And become a BW, a basic woman
But if they don't stop, it's gonna get scandalous
Oh, oh!

I've got a meeting in the ladies room
(I don't need this)
I'll be back real soon
(That's what I get for being in the neighborhood)
I've got a meeting in the ladies room
(Where's my jewelry?)
I'll be back real soon
(Can we talk?)

I don't know, but I think you better watch your man
(Girl, you better watch your man)
'Cause girl, he's doing like nobody else can
(All the girls are watching him)
If you wanna be sure, you best go powder your nose
(Go on and powder your nose)
'Cause you wanna look good when you step on the floor
That's why
You might also like
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon

Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh
Mmm, everybody, sing it like
Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh

Stepped through the door, they were standing in line
(Took their time)
Smoking funny cigarettes and taking their time
(Something must be on their minds)
Pass me a mirror (Hurry up)
'Cause I ain't got much time (Quick, I got to get right back)
Cause there's a hunk of man I done left behind
That's why

I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I told my man
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon

Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh
Everybody, sing it like
Sing, oh oh, oh oh oh
Don't be a Freak-a-Zoid
Walked on the floor and everybody was jamming
They're playing my favorite song, got me singing along
Can't turn your back for a minute, somebody's rocking my man
And girl, they're doing like nobody else can
Watch out, watch out, watch out

Excuse me, ladies, this man's with me
I don't like to share, you can plainly see
He looks good, good enough to eat
But believe me, lady, he belongs to me, yeah

I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon

Don't slap me, 'cause I'm not in the mood
Don't, don't, don't slap me, 'cause I'm not in the mood
Don't slap me, 'cause I'm not in the mood
Don't slap me, 'cause I'm not in the mood

I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soon
I've got a meeting in the ladies room, I'll be back real soonEmbed
