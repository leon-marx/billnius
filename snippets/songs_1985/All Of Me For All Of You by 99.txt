No Take Backs LyricsYour flaws aren't even flaws to me
And when you're feeling sad
Know that you can always talk to me
She has a low cut shirt
That's a booby trap
She know i'm a dawg
I call her a Scooby Snack
We smoked & then we made love
You could say I got the high score
You're so pretty looking at you makes my eyes sore

No wonder i feel like a loser
I ain't been outside all day
I've been in front of the computer
Playing first person shooters
While she's working at hooters
And it feel like forever ago
I saw you glow
I gave you roses
I left them on your porch
It was partly cloudy on the night of July 4th
And you weren't home so I left you a note
I'm always sarcastic but this isn't a joke
I miss you, yeah, whatever
Go home, get high, forget her
You might also likeFuck bitches get cheddar right?
One hit single and you set for life
Something just to get em hype
Keep em payin attention
Keep em fallin in love
Keep em falling in line
Never falling behind
I'm never not on my grind
You're a keyboard
Without the space bar
You're a bartender
I fucking hate bars
But i drink on occasion
Usually blazing
Typically cool but pretty impatient
My soul is ancient but my body is fresh
I got a lot of love to give & some hope to express
When I'm dying I will give you my best
You can have my bones and blood it ain't nothing but flesh
You're physically rich
But your soul is starving
Would have got to heaven
But you couldn't find parking
Spiritually drained
And mentally exhausted
You didn't even give your love away
You lost it
You got in my head like DMT
I saw myself inside of you
What did you see inside of me?
I saw the future
Moving furniture in
Us laughing
Having drinks with out friends
God forgiving me for all of my sins
& you loosening up because you seem really tense
If a good guy can have a bad past
And a skinny girl can have a fat ass
Then a white kid can rap
And a black kid can play chess
They mad that I'm skinny
I'm just mad that I don't weigh less
If you inside my head
Then why my heart heavy?
Huh? tell me why my heart heavy?
I am a nomad but you already know that
Once you get me started im impossible to hold back
I am a nomad, you already know that
Once you get me started I'm impossible to hold back

Stop rewind never let this happen
You don't even care you were just really good at actin
I am so sick of losing myself inside of distractions
I need something that will last
Not just another piece of ass
I mean I'm young but I'm not dumb
I don't want you for your body
I want you for your love
I'm going in
Like I don't care if you reject me
It's 99 percent a no
But that's still a one percent you let me in
On all your secrets
In that calloused heart where you keep them
I've thought of you for weeks
And now we're finally face to face
So, how are ya? great
I really do care
I just don't know how to show it
I've been fucked up for so long
That it's just hard to stay focused
You can see my movements
Only God will know my motives
That's why i blow this
I try an be a light that others notice
I try to be happy
When inside i'm hopeless
Everytime you smile
It becomes the Summer solstice
Warmer than your sunkissed soul is
And with the way that you were dancin
I would think that you were Polish
With the way that I am flowin
You would think that I had stole it
But I didn't
The beer is cold and the bowls lit
I put my life on it, I put my soul in it

If i put on my best will you show me your worst?
I got so much love inside me that sometimes it start to hurt
Why is everything a blessing and a curse at the same time?
Who she loves and who she hate is the same guyEmbed
