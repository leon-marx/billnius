Let Him Go LyricsYou're holding him so tight
That he can't move
If you never give him room
You're gonna lose
He's feeling like he's
Tied up in a knot
Every time he comes home late
He's on the spot
Trust him to be
The kind of man he wants to be
You aren't gonna keep him long
If you give him the third degree
Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you
Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you
You want your life with him
To work so well
You forget the love you need
To give yourself
You might also likeI understand your desire
To keep him near
But you poison love when
You mix it up with fear
Trust yourself to be the woman
That you want to be
If you both have room to grow
Then you'll live in harmony
Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you
Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you
Let him go, let him go
Do the things he's got to do
Give him the freedom that he needs
Even though it worries you
Let him go, let him go
Have the faith that he'll be true
It's the only way you can be sure
He'll come back to you
Let him go
Let him go, ooh
Let him go, ooh
Let him goEmbed
