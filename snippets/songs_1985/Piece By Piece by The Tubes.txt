Piece by Piece LyricsShe looks good
But she's not altogether right
All her parts are not screwed on tight
There's a touch of tragedy
When she moves
You can see the secret showing through
She'd deny it if she thought I knew
But she could never lie to me
Anyone would think there's nothing wrong
She looks so satisfied
But I've known about her much too long
She can't conceal what she feels inside
I'm gonna show her that piece by piece, inch by inch
I can put her back together again
I'll supply the love she lacks
And give her back exactly what she needs
Bringin' it piece by piece
All I need
To find a way around her defense
Is just a little common sense
I don't have a strategy
You might also likeI'll be there
Like I have so many other times
She'll reveal to me a certain sign
That only I can see
Anyone would think there's nothing wrong
She seems like she's complete
But it's obvious it's been too long
Since she believed what she needs is me
I'm gonna show her that piece by piece, inch by inch
I can put her back together again
I'll supply the love she lacks
And give her back exactly what she needs
Bringin' it piece by piece
Anyone would think there's nothing wrong
But she's not fooling me
Everybody wants to lead her on
But I believe what she needs is me--what she needs me
I'm gonna show her that piece by piece, inch by inch
I can put her back together again
I'll supply the love she lacks
And give her back exactly what she needs
Bringin' it piece by pieceEmbed
