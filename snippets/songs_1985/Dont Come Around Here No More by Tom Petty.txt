Dont Come Around Here No More Lyrics
Hey!
Hey!

Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more
Whatever you're looking for
Hey! Don't come around here no more
I've given up, stop
I've given up, stop
Ah, ah, ah, ooh-ooh
I've given up, stop, on waiting any longer
I've given up, on this love getting stronger

Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more

I don't feel you anymore
You darken my door
Whatever you're looking for
Hey! Don't come around here no more
I've given up, stop
I've given up, stop
Ah, ah, ah, ooh-ooh
I've given up, stop, you tangle my emotions
I've given up, honey please, admit it's over
You might also like
Hey! Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more
Don't come around here no more
Hey! Don't come around here no more

Stop walking down my street
Don't come around here no more
Who did you expect to meet?
Don't come around here no more
Whatever you're looking for
Hey! Don't come around here no more
Hey!

Honey please (Honey please)
Don't come around here no more
Whatever you're looking for
Don't come around here no more2Embed
