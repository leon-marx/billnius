Youre a Friend of Mine LyricsStriking out?
Well, count me in
I'm gonna stand right by your side
Through thick or thin
Ain't no doubt
Gonna win
A walk through hell ain't bad
Compared to where we've been
(Oh, you can depend on me)
Over and over
Over and over
(Know that I intend to be)
The one who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die
Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine
That argument
I can't forget
We fought so hard
I don't think I've recovered yet

Who thought you were cool
I never introduced
My favorite ones to you
(Oh, you can depend on me)
Over and over
Over and over
(Know that I intend to be)
I'm the one who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die
Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine
(Oh, you can depend on me)
Over and over
Over and over
(Know that I intend to be)
I'm the one who always makes you laugh until you cry
And you can call on me until the day you die
Years may come and go
Here's one thing I know
All my life
You're a friend of mine
You can depend on me
I'll be fine
Cause you're a friend of mine
Yeah, yeah
I'll be fine
Cause you're a friend of mine
Yeah, let me call for you one time
Ow!
