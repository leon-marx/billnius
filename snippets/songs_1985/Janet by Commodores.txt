Janet LyricsTearing me apart
Somehow I just don't care
She's playing with my heart
But Janet's so aware
And people tell me, she keeps telling you lies
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it, I believe in Janet
Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on, Janet, oh, Janet
There could never be
Another girl like Janet
It's only her and me
Together on this planet
And people tell me, she keeps telling you lies
I guess they wonder how I stand it, oh, yeah
But when I look in her eyes
I know it's love the way I planned it, I believe in Janet
Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on, Janet, oh, Janet
You might also likeWhy can't they see
Without her there'd be no reason to go on and on
As long as she stays with me
I'll keep holding on, I believe in Janet
Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on
Janet, Ja-Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on
Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrong
I gave my heart to Janet
And she won't lead me on
Janet, they don't understand it
The whole world must be wrongEmbed
