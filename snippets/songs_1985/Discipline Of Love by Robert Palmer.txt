Discipline Of Love LyricsYou naughty girl
So sharp and dry
Don't fill yourself with foolish pride
You wanted me to notice you
But when I came
You cut me
Why did you do it?
Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
You need the discipline of love
Some discipline
You wild child
How sweet you smile
Your crystal ball
It's broken
Why did you do it?
Why did you go and spoil the fun?
Why did you do it?
You need the discipline of love
Some discipline
Take notice now
My turn to talk
The gate of love
It's narrowYou might also likeEmbed
