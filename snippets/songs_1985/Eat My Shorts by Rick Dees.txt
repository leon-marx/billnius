Eat My Shorts LyricsI look at you, my stomach turns, I hate your guts
You turn to me and whisper, "You're a stupid klutz"
And baby (Baby), when your memory starts to linger
I reach out, ooh, and give you the finger
(Finger, finger, finger)
Ooh
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Yes, choke on polished cotton
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Everything we have is rotten
And baby (Baby), ooh, baby, I'll see you in court
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
You put me down, you run around, you spit in my bread
They just declared our sex life legally dead
And baby (Baby), without saying a single word
I put my hand in the air and give you the bird
(To give me the bird)
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Yes, choke on polished cotton
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Everything we hav is rotten
And baby, oh, baby, I'll see you in court
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Mmm

Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Everything we have is rotten
And baby (Baby), ooh, baby, I will see you in court
Mmm, eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Ooh, you got to, you got to eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Ooh, choke on it, choke on it
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)
Choke on polished cotton
Eat my shorts (Eat my shorts)Embed
