Looking Over My Shoulder Lyrics
If I'm calling you out of the blue
It's because it's never-ending
And if I'm dragging out pictures of you
It's because I'm only pretending

And if I'm looking over my shoulder
It's just because I hope you'll be there
And if I'm looking older and older
It's 'cause I know I haven't a prayer

When I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
It wears out after a fashion
Oh and I'm finding it hard to believe
Your whole-hearted lack of compassion

And if I'm looking over my shoulder
It's just because I hope you'll be there
And if I'm looking older and older
It's 'cause I know I haven't a prayer

You might also like
And if I'm looking over my shoulder
It's just because I hope you'll be there
And if I'm looking older and older
It's 'cause I know I haven't a prayer

And if I'm looking over my shoulder
It's just because I hope you'll be there
And if I'm looking older and older
It's 'cause I know I haven't a prayerEmbed
