Do You Want Crying LyricsSo long now
Since you walked and left me
Why did your love grow cold?
Don't you think you need me?
I see that smile, it's your face
I feel you holding on and on
I hear your voice, it's saying bye bye love
I count my teardrops as they fall
Do you want crying?
Look, I'm crying
Do you want crying?
Oh, oh, oh
You've got me crying
You've got me crying
Do you want crying?
So long now
Since you walked and left me
Why did your love grow cold?
Don't you think you need me?
Do you want crying?
Look, I'm crying
Do you want crying?
Oh, oh, oh
You've got me crying
You've got me crying
Do you want crying?
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Do you want crying?
Look, I'm crying
Do you want crying?
