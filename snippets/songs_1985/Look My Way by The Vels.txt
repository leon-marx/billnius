Look My Way LyricsOoh
I never saw nobody look so good
Yeah yeah yeah
When I saw you walking down the street
What you see, what you get
But you havent got it yet, baby
No, no, no
Cmon darlin, look my way
Cant ya see? Baby cant ya see
Youre a treasure chest
Cant ya see? Baby cant ya see
Youre second best, whoa
Ooh
I never saw nobody look so sweet
Yeah yeah yeah
Just the kind of girl I want to meet
Easy come, easy go
Easy over when you know, baby..
No no no no no
Cmon darlin look my way
Look my way
You might also likeCant ya see? Baby cant ya see
Youre a treasure chest
Cant ya see? Baby cant ya see
Youre second best
Cant ya see? Like two and three
You gotta stand in line, whoa
Cant ya see? Baby cant ya see
You've got to step behind, whoa whoa
Get hip in the middle its a trip
Cmon verybody, if you cant get down, get up
You can spin, dip, do a flip
Or fly high lik Lucy in the sky
Just put your reflex to the test
Put the tone in your funny bone
With jive house, red effect
Chinese New year, tray of dishes crashing
Babies screaming, laughing, playing
Puppies in a pet shop, dog pound
And if you cant get down, get up
Car crash, screaming tires
Puppies in a pet shop, dog pound
And if you cant get down, get up
Sing it loud now
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
I never saw nobody look so good
Oohh
Cmon darlin' look my way
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
