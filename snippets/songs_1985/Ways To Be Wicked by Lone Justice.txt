Ways to Be Wicked LyricsHoney, why you always smile
When you see me hurt so bad
Tell me what I did to you, babe
That could make you act like that
Well, I've been your fool before, honey
Yeah and I probably will again
'Cause you ain't afraid to let me have it
No, you ain't afraid to stick it in
Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
Oh, but you don't know one little thing about love
I can take a little pain
Yeah, I can hold it pretty well
I can watch your little eyes light up
While you're walking me through hell
Well, I've been your fool before, honey
Yeah, I probably will again
'Cause you ain't afraid to let me have it
No, you ain't afraid to stick it in
Well you know so many
Ways to be wicked
But you don't know one little thing about love

Light with a smile

In the devil down inside
Well, I can take a little pain

I can watch your little eyes light up
While you're walking me through hell
Well, I've been your fool before, honey
Yeah, and I probably will again
You ain't afraid to let me have it
No, you ain't afraid to stick it in
Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
Oh, but you don't know one little thing about love
Well, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
Yeah, but you don't know one little, one little thing about love
Yeah, you know so many
Ways to be wicked
But you don't know one little thing about loveEmbed
