No Lookin Back Lyrics
I'm fading out of sight
My wheels are the only sound
Runnin' at the speed of light
I can't slow down
Out on the open road
Racing to beat the night
No matter where I go
Guess I'll get there all right

So why don't I understand
What's trippin' me up
It used to be a simple thing

I can't hold on, and I can't return
Time to let go, start to live and learn

I took the one way flight
Too high to see the ground
Now I know how long it takes
A heart to come down

So why don't I understand what's trippin' me up
I know it oughta be a simple thing
You might also like
I can't hold on, and I can't return
Rivers will run, and bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how (I'm not sure just how)
But there's no lookin' back now


I can't hold on, I can't return
Rivers will run, bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how (I'm not sure just how)
But there's no lookin' back now
I can't hold on (I can't hold on), I can't return
Rivers will run (Rivers will run), bridges will burn
I'm not sure just how
But there's no lookin' back now

No lookin' back now
No lookin' back now
No lookin' back now
No lookin' back now
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, no lookin' back now, oh-ohEmbed
