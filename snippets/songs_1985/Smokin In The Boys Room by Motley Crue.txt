Smokin in the Boys Room Lyrics
Wooh!
Do you ever seem to have one of those days
Where everyone's on your case
From your teacher all the way down
To your best girlfriend?
Well, yknow I used to have those about all the time
But I found a way to get out of it
Let me tell you about!

I'm sitting in the classroom thinking it's a drag
Listening to the teacher rap, it just isn't my bag
When two bells ring, you know it's my cue
I'm gonna meet the boys on floor number two

Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Now Teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school

Checking out the halls, making sure the coast is clear
Looking in the stalls, nah, there ain't nobody here
My buddies, Sixx, Mick, and Tom
To get caught would surely be the death of us all
You might also like
Smoking in the boys room
I was smoking in the boys room
Now teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school
Hey, can I be excused?


Well, put me to work in the school book store
Check-out counter and I got bored
The teacher was looking for me all around
Two hours later, you know where I was found

Smoking in the boys room
I tell you I was smoking in the boys room
Now teacher, don't you fill me up with your rules
Everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school

Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
I tell you, I was smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Hey teacher, don't you fill me up with your rule
'Cause everybody knows that smoking ain't allowed in school
One more!
Smoking in the boys room
Smoking in the boys room
Hey, teacher, I ain't fooling around with your rules
Everybody knows that smoking aint allowed in school2Embed
