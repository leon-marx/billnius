Go Down Easy LyricsLinda lost a lover
In the early part of autumn
And she moved out to the country
Hoping all would be forgotten
The last time that I saw her
She was makin' sure the winter
Wouldn't come through that old door frame
Where the door is several inches
From the ground, the cold hard ground
And it's hard to go down easy
And it's hard to keep from cryin'
And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of autumn
Well, she learned to cook the meals
And she learned to start the fire
And she learned to make jewelry
Out of stones and precious metals
She sits down to the table
With her friends and several others
And she tries real hard to never be alone
And it's hard to go down easy
And it's hard to keep from cryin'
And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of autumn
You might also likeNow the winter wind blows cold
Upon a fair and gentle soul
And she feels as if her time is a-passin' easy
Her friends are sometimes lovers
Though they'll always be another
She thinks about when the night time lays on down
And it's hard to go down easy
And it's hard to keep from cryin'
And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of autumn
And it's hard to go down easy
And it's hard to keep from cryin'
And it's hard to lose a lover
In the early part of autumnEmbed
