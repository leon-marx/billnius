Head Over Heels Lyrics
I wanted to be with you alone
And talk about the weather
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Won't escape my attention
You keep your distance with a system of touch
And gentle persuasion
I'm lost in admiration - could I need you this much?
Oh, you're wasting my time
You're just, just, just wasting time

Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

Throw it away
Throw it away

I made a fire, Im watching it burn (yeah)
I thought of your future
With one foot in the past now just how long will it last?
No, no, no, have you no ambition?
(Mm, what's the matter with my...)
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
(Nothing ever changes when youre acting your age)
And dreaming Im a doctor
(Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby)
Its hard to be a man when theres a gun in your hand
(Nothing ever changes when youre acting your age)
Oh, I feel so
You might also like
Something happens and I'm head over heels
I never find out till I'm head over heels
Something happens and I'm head over heels
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

And this is my four leaf clover
Im on the line, one open mind
This is my four leaf clover

La la-la la la, la la-la la la
La la la-la la-la
La la-la la la, la la-la la la
La la la-la la-la
La la-la la la, la la-la la la
La la la-la la-la
La la-la la la, la la-la la la
La la la-la la-la
La la-la la la, la la-la la la
In my minds eye
La la la-la la-la
One little boy, one little man
La la-la la la, la la-la la la
