Baby, youve got a sexy body
I think I ought to tell you so
You look so deep and so delicious
I kiss you from your head to toe
If theres a chance I could romance you
Id make you scream in sheer delight
Id give you so much love and pleasure
Youd want to make love every night

And I want to dine with you
I want to drink the finest wine with you

If you want me like I want you
Then lets go wild and crazy
Im gonna give it to you
