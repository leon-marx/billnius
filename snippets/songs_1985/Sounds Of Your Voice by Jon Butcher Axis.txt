Sounds of Your Voice LyricsLa la la la la la la la
Oh, la la la la la la
The sounds of your voice in the night
They keep haunting me
The sounds of your voice late at night
They won't let me be
In the still, did I hear a sound?
A whisper like a ghost in my heart
It's so quiet, no one's around
I won't sleep tonight
I won't even start
It's so complicated these days
I wonder, did we need to leave things this way?
The sounds of your voice in the night
They won't let me be
I don't care where I'm sleeping
I don't care where I am
This frustration I feel each night
Will leave me a desperate man
But in my mind, I call your name
You might also likeThe sounds of your voice in the night
They keep calling me
The sounds of your voice in the night
They won't let me be
I wonder where you are
And if you feel all right
And I wonder if you're gone this time
'Cause somehow I'll get right through this night
I can the hear the sounds of your voice in the night
They won't let me be
The sounds of your voice in the night
Na na na na
Na na na na na
(The sounds of your voice)
I wonder where you were last night
I wonder if you feel all right
(The sounds of your voice)
La la la la
La la la la la
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(The sounds of your voice)
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Where are they when I needed you?
Oh, oh
I wonder where you were
I wonder where you are
Na na na na
Na na na na na
Yeah, yeah, yeahEmbed
