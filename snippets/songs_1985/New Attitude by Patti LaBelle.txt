New Attitude Lyrics
Runnin' hot
Runnin' cold
I was runnin' into overload
It was extreme!
I took it so high
So low
So low there was nowhere to go
Like a bad dream

Somehow the wires uncrossed
The tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from
My head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin'
And I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude
I'm in control
My worries are few
'Cause I've got love
Like I never knew
Oo, oo, oo, oo, ooh
I got a new attitude
You might also like
I'm wearing a new dress, new hat
Brand new ideals
As a matter of fact
I've changed for good
It must have been the cool night
New moon, slight change
Or that look in your eye
That makes me feel like I should

Somehow the wires uncrossed
The tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from
My head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin'
And I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude
I'm in control
My worries are few
'Cause I've got love
Like I never knew
Oo, oo, oo, oo, ooh
I got a new attitude
Oo, oo, oo, oo, ooh
Somehow the wires uncrossed
My tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

I'm feelin' good from
My head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin'
And I know what to do
I've tidied up my point of view
I got a new attitude
I'm in control
My worries are few
'Cause I've got love
Like I never knew
Oo, oo, oo, oo, ooh
I got a new attitude
Feelin' new
Feelin' new
My head to my shoes are brand new
I've got a new, new attitude
Everything about me has changed
Baby, I ain't the same
I've got a new
I've got a new
I've got a brand new, brand new attitude
Yes, I do
I've got a new...Embed
