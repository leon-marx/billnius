Four in the Morning LyricsFour in the morning
Came without a warning
Everybody's got a place to be
I got holes in my conscience
Shot with a vengeance
I must have been a fool not to see
I need you bad
It's hard to live without your company
I need you bad, so bad
I can't take it you see
Oh, I...
Can't take anymore
I can't fake anymore
It's such a hard time loving
I can't take anymore
I can't fake anymore
It's such a hard time loving you
There was a time when I knew you
I held my body to you
Made you feel like you never felt before
And now it's all in the distance
Still you keep resisting
I love you like never before
You might also likeOh, I need you bad
It's hard to live without your tender touch
I need you bad, so bad
I guess you're playing me tough
Oh, I...
Can't take anymore
I can't fake anymore
It's such a hard time loving
I can't take anymore
I can't fake anymore
It's such a hard time loving you
I guess I was going
In the wrong direction
I guess I was thrown for a while
I need to see you smile
I need you so, yeah
I must have been going
In the wrong direction
I guess I was thrown for a while
I need you bad
It's hard to live without your company
I need you bad, so bad
I can't take it you see
I need you bad
It's hard to live without your tender touch
I need you bad, so bad
I'm only taking so much
Oh, I...
Can't take anymore
I can't fake anymore
It's such a hard time loving
I can't take anymore
I can't fake anymore
It's such a hard time loving youEmbed
