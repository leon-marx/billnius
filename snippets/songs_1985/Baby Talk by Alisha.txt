Baby Talk (Extended Dance Mix) Lyrics
It's too bad not to know
I don't know, I hurt you so
Baby, talk to me
I'm so sad, I can't wait
Baby, please don't hesitate
Baby, talk to me

You never try to talk your feelings through
Communications start from me to you
We have to talk it through to clear the air
We've got to talk to show the love we share

Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
I know without a doubt
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk

Baby, please talk to me
Can't you see you're hurtin' me?
Baby, talk to me
We can see all this through
Talk will help love, me and you
Baby, talk to me
You might also like
It's hard to tell when things start goin' wrong
We'll have to talk now, before too long
So, honey, let's not throw our love away
Let's try to work it out before too late

Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
I know without a doubt
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk

You don't have to worry, baby
You don't have to fear
Tell me all the things you feel
And I will make you care
You just need to tell me, baby, what I need to say
I need to let you love me, baby, in that special way
You just need to tell me, baby, what I need to say
I need to let you love me, baby, in that special way
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
I know without a doubt
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk

Baby, talk
Baby, talk
Baby, talk
Baby, talk
Baby, talk
Baby, talk
Baby, talk
Baby, talk

Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
I know without a doubt
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
I know without a doubt
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talk
I know without a doubt
Baby, talk
We can work it out
Baby, talkEmbed
