Save the Night For Me LyricsNo one ever told me
Love could hurt like this
I picture her there in your arms
Loving every kiss
You said there was someone else
Can't say I never knew
But you give her so much each day
Is asking too much of you?
To save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together
Save the night for me
I need you now
Ooh, baby
More than ever
Save the night for me
The clock on the wall
Keeps on ticking the time away
Visions of us in the night
Get me through the day
Maybe I am just a fool
To be at your command
But I want you so bad
That I will take anything I can
You might also likeTo save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together
Save the night for me
I need you now
Ooh, baby
More than ever
Save the night for me
Save the night for me
I need you now
Baby more than ever
Save the night for me
Baby, let's be together
Save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together
Save the night for me
I need you now
Baby
More than ever
Save the night for me
Night for me
Oh, darling
I'm gonna need your loving
Save the night
Save the night
You got to know
I just can't live without you
Save the night for me
A little time
So we can be together
Save the night for me
I need you now
Ooh, baby
More than everEmbed
