What About Me Lyrics
I see you here with me
I've waited all my life
For someone like you
Someone to give my heart and soul to
I look into your eyes
Your love for me was such a welcome surprise
I think at last I've found forever

But what about me? (I'll always love you)
Oh, what about me? (I'll always need you)
You were my love before
But I need so much more of you

Time after time, I feel I'm losing my mind
Or maybe this is what lovers must go through
It never entered my mind
We could be wasting our time
What am I gonna do?

What about me?
Oh, what about me?
You might also like
No reason to pretend
True love affairs don't have to come to an end
The moment we don't have all the answers
I nearly go insane (Oh, I go insane)
Each and every time I hear you whisper my name
I feel the same when I'm around you

But what about me? (I'll always love you)
Oh, what about me? (I'll always need you)
This is so hard for me
I wanted so much to be with you, whoa

Time after time, I feel I'm losing my mind
Or maybe this is what lovers must go through
It never entered my mind
We could be wasting our time
What am I gonna do?
Time after time, I'm losing my mind
It never entered my mind
We could be wasting our time

But what about me?Embed
