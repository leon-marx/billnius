Radioactive LyricsWell, I'm not uptight
Not unattractive
Turn me on tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive
Radioactive
There's not a fight
And I'm not your captive
Turn me loose tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive
Radioactive
I want to stay with you
I want to play with you, baby
I want to lay with you
And I want you to know
Got to concentrate
Don't be distractive
Turn me on tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive
Radioactive
Radioactive
Radioactive

I don't want to play with you
I want just to lay with you
And I want you to know
Got to concentrate
Don't be distractive
Turn me loose tonight
'Cause I'm radioactive, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah, radioactive
Don't you stand, stand too close
You might catch itEmbed
