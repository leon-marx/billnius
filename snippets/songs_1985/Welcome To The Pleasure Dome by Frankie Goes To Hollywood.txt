Welcome to the Pleasuredome (Fruitness) LyricsUnder the charm of the Dionysian
Not only is the union between man and man reaffirmed
But nature, which has become alienated, hostile, or subjugated
Celebrates once more her reconciliation with her lost son, Man
Freely, Earth proffers her gifts
And peacefully, the beasts-of-prey of the rocks and desert approach
The chariot of Dionysus is covered with flowers and garlands
Panthers and tigers walk under its yoke
Transform Beethovens Hymn to Joy into a painting
Let your imagination concive the multitudes bowing to th dust, awestruck
Then you will approach the Dionysian
Now the slave is a free man
Now all the rigid, hostile barriers that necessity, caprice, or impudent convention have fixed between man and man
Are broken
Now, with the gospel of universal harmony
Each one feels himself not only united, reconciled, and fused with his neighbor
But as one with him
As if the Veil of Maya had been torn aside, and were now merely fluttering in tatters before the mysterious, primordial unity
In song and in dance, man expresses himself as a member of a higher community
He has forgotten how to walk and speak, and is on the way toward flying into the air, dancing
His very gestures express enchantment
Just as the animals now talk, and the earth yields milk and honey
Supernatural sounds emanate from him too
He feels himself a god
He himself now walks about enchanted, in ecstasy, like the gods he saw walking in his dreams
He is no longer an artist, he has become a work of art
In the paroxysms of intoxication, the artistic power of all nature reveals itself to the highest gratification of the primordial unity
The noblest clay, the most costly marble, Man, is here kneaded and cut
And to the sound of the chisel-strokes of the Dionysian world-artist
Rings out the cry of the Eleusinian Mysteries:
Do you prostrate yourselves, millions?
Do you sense your maker, world?
