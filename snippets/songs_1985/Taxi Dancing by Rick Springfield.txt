Taxi Dancing LyricsI think that it's high time we had a talk
I think that we're making a big mistake
I've been feeling lately the magic is gone
Are we just together for convenience sake, baby
I don't believe it (feeling), I don't think that's true (tied down)
It'll just pass (need to) if we allow it to (break free)
It's just a stage (they say) we're going through (clean cuts)
I think you're just restless (heal much) for something new (faster)
Baby, feeling like we pay our dime
And all we get in return is a peace of each other's time
Are we just taxi dancing, lost somewhere in a slow dance for two
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're playing for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to a feeling with desperation
Don't know if you're right, don't know if you're wrong
Seems to me we haven't danced for long
Don't make it hard (I won't), don't make it easy (hold you)
We'll just walk away (if you) at the end of the song (must go)
Baby, put one last nickel in the juke box
Give that love we once felt just one final spin around

And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
And we're just dancing
(Solo)
And the band that was playing has finally stopped playing our favorite song
Are we just taxi dancing, you're paying for me and I'm paying for you
And are we holding on to each other in desperation
