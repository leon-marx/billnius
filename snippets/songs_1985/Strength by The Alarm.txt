Strength Lyrics
Give me love
Give me hope
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for

Who will light the fire
That I need to survive?
Who will be the lifeblood
Coursing through my veins?
Like a river flowing
That will never change
I need someone
I can depend on
Oh woah, woah, oh

Won't you
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for
You might also like
I need it now
I need it now

Someone write me a letter
I need to know that I'm still alive
Someone give me a telephone call
I need to hear a human sound
Someone open up a door
And let me out of this place
I've been caged up for oh so long
I don't know if I'm living or dying
Oh woah, woah, oh

Someone better
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone to live for
Give me love (Give me love)
Give me hope (Give me hope)
Give me strength
Give me someone, someone to live for
I need it nowEmbed
