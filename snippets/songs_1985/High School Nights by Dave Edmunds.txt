High School Nights LyricsYou wake up in the morning and another night's gone
You tumble out of bed and turn the radio on
But you just can't think about the day to come
Cause you're thinking about them high school nights
Making all the moves, gotta do it in style
It merely makes the high school day worthwhile
When the work piles high
And the day drags by
And you never see the end in sight
I remember those, high school nights
We had it made them, high school nights
Those were the days them, high school nights
You will remember all your life
The day moves ahead about a light-year long
You hurry through the halls singing your school song
But you just can't follow what the hell's going on
Cause you're thinking 'bout them high school nights
Staring out the window in a daydream world
Looking at the parking lot, checking out the girls
There's a lesson going on, but it ain't getting heard
Cause you're wondering what'll happen tonight
You might also likeI remember those, high school nights
I'm gonna miss those, high school nights
They were the best those, high school nights
You will remember all your life
High school nights, we had it made
Them high school nights, those were the days
Them high school nights, could be the best days of your life
That's how it used to be, pity it couldn't last
Better days have stopped the flow of parties and livin' fast
The dean's in his office and the writing's on the wall
Some of us will make it and someone's gonna fall
But it really don't matter cause we're gonna have a ball
When we hit another high school night
I still remember those high school nights
We had it made them, high school nights
Those were the days them, high school nights
You will remember all your life
High school nights. I'm gonna miss those high school nights
They were the best, those high school nights
Could be the best days of your life
High school nights. We had it made, them high school nights
Those were the days, them high school nights
You will remember all your lifeEmbed
