Call Me Lyrics
Face to face
My reflection in your eyes
I was scared to say too much
Perfect strangers in perfect worlds apart
Almost close enough to touch
Staring at my shoes
Feeling so confused
Shot down without a gun
Victim of a hit-and-run

Won't you call me, call me?
No time to hesitate, oh, we must communicate, yeah
Call me, call me
Won't you call this number now?

Mesmerised
I go back to where we met
A reconstruction of the crime
I can't track you down
Nowhere to be found
Now my one shot at success
Is the power of the press
You might also like
Won't you call me, call me?
No time to hesitate, oh, we must communicate, yeah
Call me, call me
Won't you call this number now?

Call me
I want you to call me
Call me, call me, call me
(Worlds apart, we are worlds apart)

Watch this space
There's a message here for you
No need to read between the lines
I am inside out
There can be no doubt
I want you and no one else
Please identify yourself

Call me, call me
No time to hesitate, oh, we must communicate, yeah
Call me, call me
Won't you call this number now?
Call me, call me
I'll be waiting here for you, I don't know what else to do
Call me, call me
Girl, won't you call this number now? (Girl, won't you call me?)
Call me, call me
No time to hesitate, oh, we must communicate, uh, girl
Call me, call me
Girl, won't you call this number now?4Embed
