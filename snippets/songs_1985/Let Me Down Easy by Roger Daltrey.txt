Well I saw you on the avenue
And as usual you're with someone new
I guess there's nothing left for me to do but turn away
I'm growing tired of all your alibis
There ain't one you can justify
I ain't gonna take it anymore and I'll tell you why
You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
We've been going through some changes
And I'm well aware of all the dangers
Sometimes you look at me and it leaves me cold
But now you've gone and blown your covers
I know all about your temporary lovers
I ain't taking it another day and that's for sure
You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
You might also likeOh when I look at you now
I can't believe you're leaving
All those years and you've got nothing to say
Turn around and walk away
You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
You think it doesn't show I figure let me go
If you're gonna let me down let me down easy
It's time you got it straight you know it's hard to take
If you're gonna let me down let me down easyEmbed
