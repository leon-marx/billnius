Everyday LyricsEveryday, it's a-getting closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
A love like yours would
Surely come my way
Yeah everyday, seems a little faster
All my friends
They say: ''Go on up and ask her''
A love like yours would
Surely come my way
Oh everyday it seems a little stronger
And everyday it lasts a little longer
Come what may, do you ever long for
True love from me?
Like I long for you, baby
Said everyday seems a little closer
Going faster than a roller coaster
A love like yours would
Surely come my way
Yes a love like yours would surely
Come my way, everyday
Everyday yeah
Everyday
Each and every day, yeah
