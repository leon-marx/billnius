Dont Let Me Go Lyrics
(SK)

Don't let me go baby, I mean this shit for real (Shit for real)
I'ma give you all of me this time, I hope you feel
These niggas can't fuck with you, you laidback and you chill (And you chill)
These niggas look up to you, you made it, how that feel? (How that feel?)
Don't let me go baby, I mean this shit for real (Shit for real)
I'ma give you all of me this time, I hope you feel (Hope you feel)
These niggas can't fuck with you, you laidback and you chill (And you chill)
These niggas look up to you, you made it, how that feel? (How that feel?)

These niggas can't fuck with you, I mean that shit for real (Shit for real)
These niggas look up to you, you made it, how that feel? (How that feel?)
Don't know what more to do, but cry, this shit for real (Shit for real)
This pain on me, it hurts so bad, this shit unreal (Yah)
Them niggas can all leave, 'long as you stay hre
Sit back and watch them fake exposes reveal
Don't know what more to do, I got your kids right here (Kids right here)
They telling lies on us, that shit gon' get 'em killed (Boom)
I know you know I'm out here deciding life still
When it come down to it baby, I'm gon' grab the wheel
Why the fuck I'm the topic? You niggas a problem
Go slide if you 'bout it, no talking, you wildin'
I did everything and it worked, so we party
My nigga he knew right where my heart is
It was me and we was hurting, popping pills
You had caught a murder case, we was hurting couldn't eat no meals
Say your name and I get chills
You know how I rock, I do not fuck with the opps
Went different ways, he had died
Tissue, miss you, on her live
We went through some shit, but fuck that shit, I'm right here
I said some stuff and I don't care
Boy I'm hurting, let me heal, ooh (Let me heal, ooh)
