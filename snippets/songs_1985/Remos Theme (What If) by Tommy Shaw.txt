Remos Theme (What If) LyricsThere's a message I'm receiving
And it's coming in clear
But it's not the one that I need to hear
So if seeing is believing
You better take another look
Because I'm half-way gone and I'm hardly here
What if, what if you find you made a mistake?
What if, what if it's worth the chance that you take?
I would never want to see you standing in the line of fire
You're the one who has to come to grips with your own desires
Do you hear what I'm saying?
Am I even getting through?
Are you so far gone, I can't talk to you?
I could tell you what you want to hear
But is it really what you need?
Now it's time to stand on your own two feet
What if, what if you find you made a mistake?
What if, what if it's worth the chance that you're taking?
I would never want to see you standing in the line of fire
But you're the one who has to come to grips with your own desires
You might also likeGet a hold on yourself now
Of your heart and your soul
You've got to make a few decisions
You've got to get some self-control
What if, what if, what if you make a mistake?
What if, what if it's worth the chances you're taking?
I would never want to see you standing in the line of fire
But you're the one who has to come to grips with your own desires
And you're the only one who can decide... Hey, hey
I don't ever want to see you standing in the line of fire
You're the one who has to come to grips with your own desires
I don't ever want to see you standing in the line of fire
But you're the one who really knows what your own desires areEmbed
