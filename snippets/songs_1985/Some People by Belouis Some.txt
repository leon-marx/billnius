Some People LyricsSome people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance
Life was so simple then, a kind of playtime
You made it easy then, we had a great time
I try not to talk too fast
Like you do when you fall in love
But some people let their passion scream
And some people understand their dream
Life was so simple then, a kind of playtime
You made it easy then, we had a great time
Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance
Life was so simple then, a kind of playtime
You made it easy then, we had a great time
I take you somewhere different
It's only me can see the change
Cause some people are tied to emotion
And some people understand their dream
Life was so simple then, a kind of playtime
You made it easy then, we had a great time

Life was so simple then, a kind of playtime
You made it easy then, we had a show time
...Could you, hold you
Kind of will...
A kind of playtime
You made it easy then, we had a great time
Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance
Some people dance cheek to cheek
Some people dance
