Hold Me LyricsKind of young, very pretty
Living alone, full of fear
Feeling lost, so unhappy
Waiting for luck to appear
Meet a man, sit together
Talk about dreams, a career
Feeling good, getting closer
Putting her lips to his ear
She whispers hold me
Baby, please hold me
Make all those bad dreams disappear
She whispers hold me
Baby, please hold me
I'd feel safe for just a minute
Help me drive away my fear
Shattered dreams
Her ambitions slip from her mind
Drift away, so secure living his life
Pushing the world far away
She whispers hold me
Baby please hold me
Make all those bad dreams disappear
She whispers hold me
Baby please hold me
I'd feel safe for just a minute
Help me drive away my fearYou might also likeEmbed
