With A Woman You Love Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was a cold beer drinker, down at Joe's place
A corner pocket sinker at a pedal down pace
Another man's early was my getting home late
Fast as a whiskey shot and everything changed

[Chorus]
'Cause with a woman you love, you'll talk all night
'Bout five acres and a farmhouse and paint it bright white
With a woman you love, you'll get home at a decent hour
Don't need to look no more 'cause you finally found her
No, forever just ain't long enough
With a woman you love

[Verse 2]
I still make a little noise, raise a little hell
Running with the boys, making stories we don't tell
I'd trade a million nights of getting loose in turn four
For just one night with her dress on the floor

[Chorus]
'Cause with a woman you love, you'll talk all night
'Bout five acres and a farmhouse and paint it bright white
With a woman you love, you'll get home at a decent hour
Don't need to look no more 'cause you finally found her
No, forever just ain't long enough
With a woman you love
You might also like[Bridge]
Her whisper in my ear made a brand new man
Now the same heartbeat's got a brand new plan

[Chorus]
With a woman you love, you'll talk all night
'Bout five acres and a farmhouse and paint it bright white
With a woman you love, you'll get home at a decent hour
Don't need to look no more 'cause you finally found her
No, forever just ain't long enough
With a woman you love
Yeah
With a woman you loveEmbed
