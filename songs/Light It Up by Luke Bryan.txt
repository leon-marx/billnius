Light It Up Lyrics
I open my eyes, reach for the phone
Not a word from you baby
It dont leave my sight since we had that fight
Cant remember but maybe
I blew you up
In the middle of the night again
You were drinking with your friends
You ignored it but you got it

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know youre reading your phone
I cant help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if youre looking for my love
Then light it up
Every time I unlock my screen
I hope I see one of them red lipstick I miss you pictures
Im on your clock, youre in control
You want me now baby go figure
My worlds at the tips of your fingers

I get so neurotic about it baby
Cause I know youre reading your phone
I cant help from going crazy
Thinking you might not be all alone
I wake up, I check it, I shower and I check it
I feel the buzz in my truck
And I almost wreck it
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if youre looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, then light it up

I go to sleep, I check it
In the middle of the night, I check it
I feel the buzz in my bed
And I dont get no rest
I always got it on me
Just in case you want me
So, if youre looking for my love
Then light it up
Yeah baby, light it upYou might also likeEmbed
