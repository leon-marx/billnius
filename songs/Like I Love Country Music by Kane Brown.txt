Like I Love Country Music Lyrics[Intro]
Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Girl, you gone and done it to me, hotter than a hoochie-coochie
Got me like the first time I heard Alan Jackson "Chattahoochee"
I was never the same again, I'm a lifelong fan
Yes, I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I love you like I love country music

[Chorus]
You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June did, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music

[Verse 2]
'Caus I could never live without ya or my favorit songs about ya
Top-to-bottom perfect, you're like Brooks & Dunn's debut album
You got me feelin' like I'm a brand new man (Oh, I'm a brand new man)
Yes, I am

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I love you like I love country music
(Yeah, I love country music, oh)
You might also like[Chorus]
You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June did, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music

[Post-Chorus]
Hit 'em with it, woo
Play that fiddle

[Bridge]
If I was stranded on an island, only way I could survive is
If I had you and that needle droppin' on a vinyl

[Chorus]
You get me high as Willie, girl, you get me gone as Jones
You turn me on as much as I turn on my radio
Let's take our time, walk the line kinda like
Johnny and June did, yeah, let's do this
Baby, I love you like I love country music
Oh, baby, I love you like I love country music

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, that's right
[Outro]
One, two, one, two, three, woo
That's right
Baby, I love you like I love country music
Hit 'em againEmbed
