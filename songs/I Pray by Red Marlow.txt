I Pray Lyrics
When I look up from the bottom
I still don't see the light
I feel like my whole world
Is stuck in the darkest night
There's a million different questions
That my mind's running through
And I don't know exactly what to do

I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
When I pray
When I'm searching for the answer
But I can't find the truth
And I'm ready just to give up
Give in and just be through
I lift my eyes towards heaven
And I see it loud and clear
Everything I'm looking for is just right here


I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
And he's never really ever far away
When I pray
I pray, I get down on my knees and drift away
He covers me with his amazing grace
When I need it, he fills that empty space
And it always seems to take the hurt away
And he's never really ever far away
When I pray
