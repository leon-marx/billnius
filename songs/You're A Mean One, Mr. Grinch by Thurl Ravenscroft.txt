Youre a Mean One, Mr. Grinch Lyrics[Verse 1: Thurl Ravenscroft]
You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel, Mr. Grinch
You're a bad banana with a
Greasy black peel

[Verse 2: Thurl Ravenscroft]
You're a monster, Mr. Grinch
Your heart's an empty hole
Your brain is full of spiders
You've got garlic in your soul, Mr. Grinch
I wouldn't touch you with a
Thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole
[Interlude: Boris Karloff]
"All I need is a reindeer"
The Grinch looked around
But since reindeer are scarce
There was none to be found
Did that stop the Grinch? Ha, the Grinch simply said
"If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one instead"
So he took his dog, Max, and he took some black thread
And he tied a big horn on the top of his had
Then he loaded som bags and some old empty sacks
On a ramshackle sleigh and he whistled for Max
Then the Grinch said, "Giddap"
And the sleigh started down
Toward the homes where the Whos lay
A-snooze in their town
All their windows were dark
No one knew he was there
All the Whos were all dreaming
Sweet dreams without care
When he came to the first little house on the square
"This is stop number one, "the old Grinchy Claus hissed
As he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist
Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch
He got stuck only once, for a minute or two
Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue
Where the little Who stockings hung all in a row
"These stockings," he Grinched, "are the first things to go"
Then he slithered and slunk with a smile most unpleasant
Around the whole room and he took every present
Pop guns, pampoonas, pantookas and drums
Checkerboards, bizzel-binks, popcorn and plums
Then he stuffed them in bags, then the Grinch, very nimbly
Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the chimneyYou might also likeEmbed
