[Intro: All]
BLACKPINK, BLACKPINK
BLACKPINK, BLACKPINK

[Verse 1: Jennie & Lisa]
Kick in the door, waving the coco
     
I talk that talk, runways I walk, walk
  pop, pop   
One by one, then two by two
      
   
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar outta me

[Pre-Chorus: Rose & Jisoo]
  
   
   
Look what you made us do
   fire (Fire)
  
I bring the pain like

[Chorus: Jennie & Lisa]
This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah
Straight to ya dome like ah, ah, ah
Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah
Straight to ya dom like ah, ah, ah

Black paint and ammo, got bodies like Rambo
Rst in peace, please light up a candle, this the life of a vandal
Masked up and I'm still in CELINE
Designer crimes or it wouldn't be me (Ooh)
Diamonds shinin', drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
And I'm wildin', stylin' on them and there's no chance
'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance

[Pre-Chorus: Jisoo & Rose]
  
   
   
Look what you made us do
   fire (Fire)
  
I bring the pain like

[Chorus: Lisa & Jennie]
This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah
Straight to ya dome like ah, ah, ah
Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom, get 'em, get 'em, get 'em
Straight to ya dome like woah, woah, woah
Straight to ya dome like ah, ah, ah
[Bridge: Rose, Jisoo, Rose & Jisoo, Lisa]
 provoke us
  and you know this
  shot that potion
   ocean
Come and give me all the smoke
   like I'm so rock and roll
Come and give me all the smoke
     stop, drop
I bring the pain like

[Outro: Jennie, Lisa & All]
