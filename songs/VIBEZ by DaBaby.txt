VIBEZ Lyrics[Intro]
Let's go (Yeah, yeah, Neeko, you made that motherfuckin' beat? Ah, nah)
You know it's Baby, nigga, hahaha
Hah
(Oh Lord, Jetson made another one), ha

[Chorus]
She wanna fuck with me, but I don't got the time (Mmh, mmh)
I just hopped off a private plane and went and hopped on 85 (Yeah)
Go call my chauffeur, bitch, 'cause I don't like to drive
We in Suburbans back to back and we gon' fill 'em up with vibes (Let's go)
[Verse 1]
Fill 'em with vibes (Yeah), get in and ride (Yeah, yeah)
And no, a nigga not blind (Uh-uh)
But I keep the stick and I'm firin' (Bitch)
I ain't met a nigga in life
That's fuckin' with me, say he did, then he lyin' (Mmh, mmh)
Got so many vibes stuffed in the car
We can fuck them hoes six at a time (No cap)
I make them hoes say, "That nigga so fine" (Ooh)
"Girl, he got the dick you can feel in your spine" (Yeah)
Yeah, that what they say about Baby
You know that them bitches don't play about Baby
Baby should go run for president
Look what God did, took his time with me (Yeah, yeah)
Got a red and white ho like a peppermint (Ooh)
Book the hotel, take the vibes in
She gon' fuck me and fuck on my brethren (Uh)
My brother 'nem, havin' three hoes in the king size
I ain't finished yet (Mmh), get another bitch (Mmh)
Got her ridin' dick and screamin', "Yeehaw" (Mmh, mmh, mmh, mmh)
Make me proud, girl, you a cowgirl (Huh?)
Did a handstand, I'm like, "Wow, girl" (Okay, okay)
Got me fuckin' her upside-down (Ooh, mmh), baow, baow
Yeah, we goin' dumb, say she wanna cum (Mmh)
I'm lookin' like, "When?" She lookin' like, "Now"
Some more came in, say they want it too
I tagged in my brother, bitch, I'm out (Bye), I know

Hop out with a pole like a troop (Yeah, get in there)
