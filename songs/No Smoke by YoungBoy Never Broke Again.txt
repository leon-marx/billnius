TranslationsFrancaisNo Smoke Lyrics
DJ Chose

My bro, my bro, that nigga my homie
Count money, fuck hoes, make sure you get money
We laugh, we joke, 'cause all the opps funny
Put that on God, man, these niggas don't want no smoke
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
I can't go, won't go, won't leave my mama lonely
No smoke, no smoke, but we die 'bout that money
No smoke, no smoke, you niggas don't want it
I heard these niggas want smoke (Want smoke), they better pull up with a hundred
Yeah, we want all the smoke, I walk around with it on me
Draco protect me, you ain't taking nothing
Boy, you can try me, you know I'ma burn you
Quick to come to it, we ain't never running
These niggas hating, they mad 'bout something
You know I'ma blow, I ain't never stuntin' (You know I'ma blow)
You know how I'm coming, you know what to do if you ever want it (if you ever want it)
Nigga stop all that talking you know where I'm at come and pull up on me (Skrt, skrt)
I hope you don't slack, you know that I'm dumping

My bro, my bro, that nigga my homie
Count money, fuck hoes, make sure you get money
We laugh, we joke, 'cause all the opps funny
Put that on God, man, these niggas don't want no smoke
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
I can't go, won't go, won't leave my mama lonely
No smoke, no smoke, but we die 'bout that money
No smoke, no smoke, you niggas don't want it

Drop one, one down and we gon' kill 'em all
Shoot you and yo' boy and whoever around
Try to get away and we gon' run 'em down
He get back up, Ben knocking him down
When you say my name, nigga, be specific
You know how we living, that ain't how you living
If you go to tripping, get hit with the glizzy
Ain't no hesitation, we bring it to you bitches
Forty Glocks and extensions
These niggas talking, I ain't hearing
Nigga better mind they business
Gone get it too if you get in it
Forever posted in the trenches
Swear that we forever spinning
These niggas talk like they with it
When I catch you, you gone get it
You might also like
My bro, my bro, that nigga my homie
Count money, fuck hoes, make sure you get money
We laugh, we joke, 'cause all the opps funny
Put that on God, man, these niggas don't want no smoke
No smoke, no smoke
You niggas don't want it
I can't go, won't go, won't leave my mama lonely
No smoke, no smoke, but we die 'bout that money
No smoke, no smoke, you niggas don't want it15Embed
