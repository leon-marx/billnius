Petal on the vine, too young to drink wine
Just five years a bleeder, student and a teacher
Far from innocent, what the fuck's consent?
Numbers told you not to, but that didn't stop you

[Chorus]
Finally twenty-nine
Funny, just like you were at the time
Thought it was a teenage dream, just a fantasy
But was it yours or was it mine?
Seventeen, twenty-nine
[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Seventeen, twenty-nine

[Verse 2]
Had me in your grip, went beautifully with
All my daddy issues and this shit continues
I see you're quite the collector
Yeah, you're twelve years her elder
Maybe now it doesn't matter
But I know fucking better
Now I know fucking better 'cause I'm

[Chorus]
Finally twenty-nine
Funny, just like you were at the time
Thought it was a teenage dream, just a fantasy
But was it yours or was it mine?
Seventeen, twenty-nine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Seventeen, twenty-nine
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Seventeen, twenty-nine

Finally twenty-nine
Seventeen would never cross my mind
Thought it was a teenage dream, a fantasy
But it was yours, it wasn't mine
Seventeen, twenty-nine

[Outro]
