Whiskey On You Lyrics[Verse 1]
Now I've wasted a paycheck on whiskey and longnecks
Ever since you left trying to figure this out
This Jack I've been drinking's been wasted on thinking
Now I got a new reason for throwing 'em down
Line 'em up (Line 'em up), pour 'em tall (Pour 'em tall)
Here's to us, happily never after all

[Chorus]
Ain't gonna waste one more night missing, wanting you back
No, I ain't gonna cry another tear in this glass
You didn't waste any time finding somebody new
So, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you
No, I ain't

[Verse 2]
To hell with the lonely, and the "why don't you want me?"
Yeah, bartender pour me a farewell round
Line 'em up (Line 'em up), make 'em strong (Make 'em strong)
Tell the band that I need me a drinking song

[Chorus]
Ain't gonna waste one more night missing, wanting you back
No, I ain't gonna cry another tear in this glass
You didn't waste any time finding somebody new
So, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you
No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you
No, I ain't
No, I ain't

Ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you, no
Ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you
Line 'em up (Line 'em up), pour 'em tall (Pour 'em tall)
Here's to us happily never after all

[Chorus]
Ain't gonna waste one more night missing, wanting you back
No, I ain't gonna cry another tear in this glass
You didn't waste any time finding somebody new
So, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you
No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you

[Post-Chorus]
No, I ain't, yeah (Gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you)
No, I ain't (Gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you)
Ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you
No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you
No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on you

[Outro]
No, I ain't
No, I ain't gonna waste another drop of whiskey on youEmbed
