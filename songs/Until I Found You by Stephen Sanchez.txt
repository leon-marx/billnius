Until I Found You Lyrics[Verse 1: Stephen Sanchez]
Georgia
Wrap me up in all your
I want ya
In my arms, oh, let me
Hold ya
I'll never let you go again
Like I did
Oh, I used to say

[Chorus: Stephen Sanchez & Georgia Brown]
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall, unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you

[Verse 2: Stephen Sanchez & Georgia Brown]
Georgia
Pulled me in, I asked to
Love her
Once again, you fell, I
Caught ya
I'll never let you go again
Like I did
Oh, I used to say
You might also like[Chorus: Stephen Sanchez & Georgia Brown]

I found you

[Chorus: Stephen Sanchez & Georgia Brown]
"I would never fall in love again until I found her"
I said, "I would never fall unless it's you I fall into"
I was lost within the darkness, but then I found her
I found you11Embed
