Half Of Me Lyrics[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
I'm supposed to mow the grass today
I'm supposed to fix the fence
But with the sun beaten down on me
It's hard to make it make sense

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, that's the cold hard truth
And with the frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
And the other half does too
[Verse 2: Riley Green]
Yeah, I kinda need to wash my truck
But hell, I kinda don't care
I think old Alan Jackson said it best
"It's five o'clock somewhre"

[Chorus: Riley Green]
Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, that's th cold hard truth
And with the 'frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
Yeah, the other half does too

[Bridge: Thomas Rhett & Riley Green]
Yeah, yeah
Half of me wants a cold beer
If I did what I should be doin' but then that would really ruin all the fun, yeah
There's a world of bad decisions out there, but this ain't one

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Riley Green]
'Cause half of me wants a cold, cold beer
Yeah, that's the cold hard truth (Yeah, it is)
And with the 'frigerator stocked full of 'em
Tell me, what's a boy to do?
I ain't even tryna fight it, it's already been decided
The sky and the mountains are blue
Half of me wants a cold beer
And the other half does too
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Riley Green & Thomas Rhett]
Yeah, half of me wants a cold, cold beer
The other half wants two

[Outro: Riley Green]
Woo-hoo!
That sounds good, but I can't tell if that's your end or notEmbed
