Happy Holiday/The Holiday Season Lyrics[Chorus]
Happy holiday
Happy holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
Happy holidays to you!

[Verse 1]
It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus is coming 'round
The Christmas snow is white on the ground
When ol' Santa gets into town
He'll be coming down the chimney, down!
(He'll be coming down the chimney, down!)
[Verse 2]
It's the holiday season
And Santa Claus has got a toy
For every good girl and good little boy
Santa's a great big bundle of joy
When he's coming down the chimney, down!
(When he's coming down the chimney, down!)

[Verse 3]
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree!

[Refrain]
It's the holiday season
(The holiday season)
With the whoop-de-do and dickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney, down!
(He'll be coming down the chimney, down!)

[Pre-Chorus]
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

It's the holiday season
(The holiday season)
With the whoop-de-do and dickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause at just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney, down!

[Pre-Chorus]
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

[Refrain]
It's the holiday season
With the whoop-de-do and hickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney, down!

[Refrain]
He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree
[Chorus]
Happy holiday

While the merry bells keep ringing
Happy holidays to you

May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you
To you
