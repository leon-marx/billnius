Like Its Christmas Lyrics[Intro]
Dum-dum-dum-dum

[Verse 1: Nick Jonas]
There's snow on the ground, love in the air, sleigh bells are ringin'
This is what it's all about, the fire is warm, the angels are singin'

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas with Joe Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year
[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Verse 2: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
Look at the lights, twinklin' bright twenty-four/seven
Every inch of Central Park is covered in white, this could be heaven

[Pre-Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
And I don't wanna miss a single thing
Don't wanna put an end to all this cheer
But as long as you're with me
It's always that time of the year, yeah (Woo)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas, Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas), never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

Woo, woo, woo, yeah (Everyday that I'm with you)
Everyday, every night (Oh, oh, all day)

[Chorus: Joe Jonas with Nick Jonas]
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas, never wanna stop
Feelin' like the first thing on your wishlist, right up at the top (And I can't deny)
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
Nothin' fake about the way you bring me to life
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas
Everyday that I'm with you

[Outro: Joe Jonas & Nick Jonas]
Hey, hey, yeah, everyday, la-la-la
I can't deny what I'm feelin' inside
No matter the reason, no matter the season
My heart'll keep beatin', you better believe
You make everyday feel like it's Christmas (Like it's Christmas)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Everyday that I'm with you1Embed
