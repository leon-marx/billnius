TranslationsDeutschLet Me Go Lyrics
You made plans and I, I made problems
We were sleeping back to back
We know this thing wasn't built to last

Good on paper, picture-perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black
(Ooh-ooh)
And I wished that you would hurt me harder than I hurt you
(Ooh-ooh)
And I wish you wouldn't wait for me, but you always do
I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

Someone will love you, let me go
D-Don't
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

It's been some time, but this time ain't even
I can leave it in the past
But you're holding on to what you never had

Good on paper, picture-perfect
Chased the high too far, too fast
Picket white fence, but we paint it black
(Ooh-ooh)
And I wished that you would hurt me harder than I hurt you
(Ooh-ooh)
And I wish you wouldn't wait for me but you always do
You might also like
I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin' (I've been hopin')
Someone will love you, let me go

Someone will love you, let me go
D-Don't
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go

(Go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go
(Go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go
(Go, go, go) (Someone will love, someone will love)
Someone will love you, let me go
(Go, go, go)
Someone will love you, let me go

I've been hopin'
Somebody loves you in the ways I couldn't
Somebody's taking care of all of the mess I've made
Someone you don't have to change
I've been hopin'
Someone will love you, let me go31Embed
