Yungen Lyrics[Intro: Eelmatic]
How you tell me love me? You knew you wouldn't keep me around
Done with the fightin', I don't want discussions, so now I'm just tunin' you out
We out in public and you talkin' crazy, you steadily runnin' your mouth
This aint the time to be chewing me out, you should've listened, I told you my time was comin', my time was now, now


[Chorus: Rod Wave]
And they say, "Ooh, there go the youngin," yeah, yeah
Make way for him, yeah, yeah
They say, "Ooh, there go the youngin," yeah, yeah
[Verse 1: Rod Wave]
We was waitin' for him, ooh, there go the youngin
This was my dream, I always believd, but I couldn't see this comin
I used to walk to the school, walk to the stor, catch the buses
Now I'm in back of the 'Bach and catchin' jets across the country
I had to find a grind, find the time and make out a plan
I used to hit my knees, talk to God, and beg for a chance
I used to go on tours, open up and open up again
Now you can book a show and I'ma bring fifteen thousand fans
I still remember high school, I ain't fuck with nobody
Mama lookin' at me crazy when I told her, "Fuck college"
I couldn't follow rules, got me kicked out my mama house
Told you I'd be a star sittin' on your mama couch (Yeah)

[Chorus: Rod Wave & Jack Harlow]
Yeah, they say, "Ooh, there go the youngin," yeah, yeah
Make way for him, yeah, yeah (Make way, make way, yeah)
They say, "Ooh, there go the youngin," yeah, yeah
We was waitin' for him, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-ooh (Mmm)

[Verse 2: Jack Harlow]
I was an open at ACT back when I took my ACTs
Back when I took a lil' A-D-D-Y, but I didn't have no ADD
South by Southwest, A3C, now they wanna treat my name like an ATV
Draggin' that through the mud, sweat, tears, and the blood
I don't follow trends, orders, crowds, rules, I just follow my gut
This whole world, that's all that I want, your main girl, that's all that I want
Just one spin, I'll call when I'm done
Whole nation full of kids with the same haircut, I call 'em my sons
Told my dawg look at what we done, look at that crowd, look at where we from
Fifteen deep, "Look it, here he comes," hear ye, hear ye, here we come
Y'all still here, but you're nearly done, sincerely, um, the greatest
They just wanna degrade us 'cause the heat wave is equal to the equators
Would you rather me be her screensaver or the one that she sees later?
Think on it, we'll speak later, Rod Wave, it's gon' be a while 'til we waiver
You might also like[Chorus: Rod Wave]
Yeah, they say, "Ooh, there go the youngin," yeah, yeah
Make way for him, yeah, yeah (Oh, make way for him, thank God)
They say, "Ooh, there go the youngin," yeah, yeah (Thank God)
We was waitin' for him, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-ooh

[Outro]
We begin with breaking news tonight
A heavy police presence right now at Pier Six Downtown, Pier Six Pavilion
Rod Wave, a rapper was just wrapped up a performance
And there were reports that the Pavilion was almost in capacity with a large crowd left outside
Some people thought what a wise one would say: "They paid for tickets, but they were not able to get inside and see the show"1Embed
