Soul Lyrics[Verse 1]
Your body's got me weak
You're Mozart in the sheets
You make a sinner out of me
I'ma need a priest

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll be singing, Holy Mother of Moses
I just wanna buy you roses
Open every door that closes
And kiss you from your head to your toeses
[Chorus]
I like your soul, baby
You've got that heart made of gold, baby
I'm gonna love you till I'm old, baby
I just wanna be your baby
I like your soul (I like your soul)
I like your soul (I like your soul)

[Verse 2]
Don't need to be undressing
To feel like you're impressing
Must've died and gone to heaven
Go on and take me to confession (Giv me five)

[Pre-Chorus]
You've got m singing, Holy Mother of Moses
I just wanna buy you roses
Open every door that closes
And kiss you from your head to your toeses

[Chorus]
I like your soul, baby
You've got that heart made of gold, baby
I'm gonna love you till I'm old, baby
I just wanna be your baby
I like your soul (I like your soul)
I like your soul (I like your soul)
Just so you know (Just so you know)
I like your soul, baby
You might also like[Chorus]
I like your soul, baby
You've got that heart made of gold, baby
I'm gonna love you till I'm old, baby
I just wanna be your baby
I like your soul, baby
You've got that heart made of gold, baby
I'm gonna love you till I'm old, baby
I just wanna be your baby
I like your soul (I like your soul)
I like your soul (I like your soul)Embed
