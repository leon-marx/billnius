Legends Lyrics
We were golden, we were fire, we were magic
Yeah, and they all knew our names all over town
We had it made in the middle of the madness
We were neon in a grey crowd
Yeah, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didnt do it for the fame or the glory
But we went down in history

Yeah, we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, wed never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
Ill always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And theyll remember
We were legends
Like we were written down in permanent marker
Not even the brightest sun could ever fade
Come whichever, Hell or high water
It was always me and you either way
Hey, we wrote our own story
Full of blood, sweat, and heartbeats
We didnt do it for the fame or the glory
We just did it for you and me

And thats why we were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, wed never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
Ill always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And theyll remember
We were legends
Oh, woah

We were legends
Loving you, baby, it was Heaven
What everyone wondered, wed never question
Close our eyes and took on the world together
Do you remember baby?
We were crazy
Tragic and epic and so amazing
I'll always wear the crown that you gave me
We will always stay lost in forever
And theyll remember
We were legends
We were
Yeah, we were legends
Yeah, we wrote our own storyYou might also like5Embed
