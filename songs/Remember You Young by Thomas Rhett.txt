Remember You Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
Hey, buddies that I grew up with
All straight-laced and married up now
You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago
We tore the roof off that one red light town
And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine
All classy, kicked back on the couch
You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila
Us shuttin' them college bars down

[Chorus]
And no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much we grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young
[Verse 2]
And hey, babies, crawlin on the carpet
No, you wont be that little for long
One day, youll move away, but youre still gonna stay
This innocent after youre gone

[Chorus]
'Cause no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much you grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Yeah, I hope when we get to Heaven
He looks at us all like we're kids
Shameless and painless and perfect and ageless
Forgives all the wrong that we did

[Chorus]
And no matter how much time goes by
I hope we never have to grow up
We'll say for worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

Whoa-oh-oh, oh
I'll always remember you youngEmbed
