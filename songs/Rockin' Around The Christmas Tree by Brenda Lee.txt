Rockin Around The Christmas Tree Lyrics[Intro: Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh

[Verse: Brenda Lee]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
[Pre-Chorus: Brenda Lee & Chorus, both]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly (Ooo)
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus: Brenda Lee]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way

[Saxophone Solo]

[Pre-Chorus: Brenda Lee & Chorus, both]
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly (Ooo)
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"

[Chorus: Brenda Lee & Chorus]
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way (Ahh)You might also like9Embed
