TranslationsTurkceEnglishLeft and Right Lyrics[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind
(Whatcha gon' do now?)

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
Ever since the d-day y-you went away
(No, I don't know how)
How to erase your body from out my brain
(Whatcha gon' do now?)
Maybe I should just focus on me instead
(But all I think about)
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Oh, no (Oh, no)
Oh, no (Oh, no)
You're going 'round in circles
Got you stuck up in my head, yeah

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over hre
You take up evry corner of my mind
Your love stays with me day and night
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind
(Whatcha gon' do now?)

Ever since the d-day y-you went away

(Now all I think about)
Are the nights we were tangled up in your bed

Oh, no (Oh, no)

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
Did you know you're the one that got away?
And even now, baby, I'm still not okay
Did you know that my dreams, they're all the same?
Every time I close my eyes
[Chorus: Charlie Puth, Jung Kook]
Memories follow me left and right
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here
You take up every corner of my mind

Your love stays with me day and night
I can feel you over here, I can feel you over here (Oh)
You take up every corner of my mind
(Whatcha gon' do now?)

You take up every corner of my mind
