BEST ON EARTH Lyrics[Chorus: Russ & BIA]
Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around
But I swear you got the best on Earth, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me
I'm not fillin' up, baby, I let him gas me

[Verse 1: Russ]
Yeah
Her ass fatter than fat and she got good throat
Sit that cat on my lap, I give it good strokes
I might have to fly her out to Mykonos
Or maybe to Japan so I can hit her like I'm Ichiro
She knows what the fuck is up, I don't gotta dumb it down
Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her, she's a freak
I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace
Head got me wobblin'
She know I got cameras, she say, "We should vlog it"
I know she got stamina, she said, "Start joggin'," yeah
[Chorus: Russ & BIA]
Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around
But I swear you got the best on Earth, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me (Uh)
I'm not fillin' up, baby, I let him gas me (Uh)

[Verse 2: BIA]
Light me up (Light me up), light me up
I done seen the whole world and ain't no one as hot as us
Bankrolls, dank rolled, they ain't really as loud as us
I be hopin' that it's love, but it really just be the lust
Anything for a rush now, it's Van Nuys on the touchdown
It's a cold world, get a bust down
How you get my mind before my body and my trust now?
He say life is too short and he think that we should fuck now
I think I'm finna break him, it's gon' be quick
He know I ride that dick 'til I get seasick
Wavy lil' bitch to talk that East shit
Nasty, but don't put nothin' past me
Now I got the pussy and the power if you ask me

[Chorus: Russ & BIA]
Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around
But I swear you got the best on Earth, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me
I'm not fillin' up, baby, I let him gas meYou might also like20Embed
