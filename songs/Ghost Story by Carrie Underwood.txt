Ghost Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
You're gonna see a shadow
Midnight playing tricks with your head
A silhouette float down the hallway
And you'll reach for the light by your bed

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll hear a noise, swear you know the voice
And you'll chase it down the stairs
You'll look around, not a single sound
'Cause there's no one even there

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be your ghost story
That keeping you up all night memory
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story
Your ghost story
Your ghost story

[Verse 2]
You'll be sitting at home drinking 'bout me
When I'm out with my friends at the bar
But there ain't enough whiskey for you not to miss me
I'll be waitin' at the bottom of the bottle in the dark
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm gonna be your ghost story
That keeping you up all night memory
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story
Your ghost story, yeah (Ooh, ooh)
Your ghost story (Ooh, ooh)

[Bridge]
Oh, you'll wish you never said goodbye
Wish you'd never let me go
Let the love between us die
You can carve it into stone

[Chorus]
I'm gonna be your ghost story
That keeping you up all night memory
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story
Your ghost story, yeah, yeah
Your ghost story, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
I'll be haunting you, you'll be wanting me
I'm gonna be your ghost story
Your ghost storyEmbed
