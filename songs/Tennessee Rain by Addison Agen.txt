Tennessee Rain Lyrics
You never see it coming, it happens all of a sudden
And when it finally hits you, it's too late
He just sat there in the silence, on his own private island
I wasn't ready for the storm about to break
Yesterday, there was no trace of trouble
Now he's given up more than I can take

He said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain
Nobody showed me, nobody told me
What to do when the story turned out wrong
Or how a heart does its mending, without the perfect ending
The one I always thought would come along
He had his own ideas of where this love was going
He wasn't leaving it up to the hands of fate

He just said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain

He said hold on tight, it's gonna be a heck of a night
Especially when you hear what I've got to say
And when he said, I don't love you
The first tear broke through
Now it's comin' down
Like a Tennessee rain

It's comin' down harder than a Tennessee rainYou might also like2Embed
