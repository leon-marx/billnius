Mine$om (Parody of Ran$om by Lil Tecca) Lyrics[Intro]
Turn you to a miner
Yeah

[Chorus]
I got pigs I got swords which you want
Hop outside the house and hop into a minecart
TNT bout to blooaw up the ghast
They tryna kill my player I take them for minesom
I know that Im gone
See TNT blowing up people greifing my home
I got 2 twin picks turn you to a miner
I got 300 pick grief they base when Im alone
I got 2 ender pearls teleport to stronghold
[Verse]
I got picks I got swords which you want
I know I got a stack of diamond emerald and such
Noobies tryna greif me they know they dont belong
I needed me a map to ever find strong hold
I started from the bottom you could see me killing mobs
I run out of diamonds I need em way more than before
The noobies tryna kill me cause Im playing while they bored
But them noobies dont know me Ill hit them with my sword
I got lots of greifers pulling up into my place
But I dont want them there Ill just chase them away
Creepers tryna blow me up into space

[Chorus]
I got pigs I got swords which you want
Hop outside the house and hop into a minecart
TNT bout to blooaw up the ghast
They tryna kill my player I take them for minesom
I know that Im gone
See TNT blowing up people greifing my home
I got 2 twin picks turn you to a miner
I got 300 pick grief they base when Im alone
I got 2 ender pearls teleport to strong hold
I got pigs I got swords which you want
Hop outside the house and hop into a minecart
TNT bout to blooaw up the ghast
They tryna kill my player I take them for minesom
I know that Im gone
See TNT blowing up people greifing my home
I got 2 twin picks turn you to a miner
I got 300 pick grief they base when Im alone
I got 2 ender pearls teleport to strongholdYou might also likeEmbed
