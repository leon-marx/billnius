Dont Come Lookin Lyrics[Intro]
(One, two, a-three, a-three)

[Verse 1]
Got a head full o' noise
'Bout a hundred different things I'm tryna avoid
I got a mind in the gutter
Trouble on one hand, a beer in the other

[Pre-Chorus]
Got the windows down and my fingers crossed
Just looking for a brand-new way to get lost
[Chorus]
So long, four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas down the road I'm burnin'
Can't say I would and I can't say I wouldn't
If I don't come back, don't come a lookin'

[Verse 2]
Feels good, about time
Blue skies ahead and BS behind
Got the wind in my hair
Got nowhere to go so I'm already there
Maybe Moab, maybe the Rockies
Maybe the Great Soft Plains or the hills of Kentucky
Maybe north, maybe south
I don't care as long as it's now

[Chorus]
So long, four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas down the road I'm burning
Can't say I would and I can't say I wouldn't
If I don't come back, don't come a lookin'

[Bridge]
Come on-on-on-on, if you wanna get down tonight
Come on-on-on-on, if you're lookin' for a real good time
Come on-on-on-on, if you kinda wanna lose your mind
You might also like[Chorus]
So long, four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas down the road I'm burnin'
Can't say I would and I can't say I wouldn't
If I don't come back, don't come a lookin'

[Outro]
So long, four wheels turnin'
Got a tank full of gas down the road I'm burnin'
Can't say I would and I can't say I wouldn't
If I don't come back, don't come a lookin'Embed
