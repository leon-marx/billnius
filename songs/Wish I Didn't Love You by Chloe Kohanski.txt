Wish I Didnt Love You Lyrics
I remember where we used to dance
Out by the well, under the moon
You were begging me for half a chance
Summer was gone, we were in bloom

Just two kids with pockets full of pennies
Singing every wish to our own melody

Oh my love
Tell me is it wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
Oh, I'll be fine
If I could forget
Don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you
I never knew the stars could be so bright
Under the blanket, over the moon

Something more than words, your heart was telling me
Everything word you whispered was a melody


Oh my love
Tell me is it wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
Oh, I'll be fine
If I could forget
Oh, don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you

Oh, I wish I didn't know
Oh, how could it be
And that it could break so easily
I guess I could say it wasn't me
Oh, but it was
And I know it's wrong
Swaying to this song
Holding memories of you
No, I try
And if I could forget
Oh, don't you think I would
Wish to god I could
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love you
I wish I didn't love youYou might also likeEmbed
