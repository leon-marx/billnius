She Likes It Lyrics[Verse 1: Russell Dickerson]
She likes it when I wear a suit
Pick her favorite movie
When I open up
When she's talkin' to me
When I go get groceries
And I bring back flowers
And I rub her back
For like half an hour

[Pre-Chorus: Russel Dickerson]
Ooh oh oh
She likes it when I
Ooh oh oh

[Chorus: Russell Dickerson]
She likes it when I pour tequila
'Cause she knows that we about to
Have ourselves a little night
When I play John Denver
Through that little Bose speaker
And I start dimming those lights
And she knows by the way that I'm kissing on her
That we gon' take our time
She likes it when I
She likes it when I
She likes it when I mmm

When I leave a note
Make us reservations
Just because
That girl's worth celebrating
When I already know
What she's thinkin'
She don't have to say it yeah

[Chorus: Russell Dickerson and Jake Scott]
She likes it when I pour tequila
'Cause she knows that we about to
Have ourselves a little night
When I play John Denver
Through that little Bose speaker
And I start dimming those lights
And she knows by the way that I'm kissing on her
That we gon' take our time
She likes it when I
She likes it when I
She likes it when I mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Russel Dickerson and Jake Scott]
Ooh oh oh
She likes it when I
Ooh oh oh
I love it when we
Ooh oh oh
She likes it when I
Ooh oh oh
[Chorus: Russell Dickerson and Jake Scott]
She likes it when I pour tequila
'Cause she knows that we about to
Have ourselves a little night
When I play John Denver
Through that little Bose speaker
And I start dimming those lights
And she knows by the way that I'm kissing on her
That we gon' take our time
She likes it when I
She likes it when I
She likes it when I mmm1Embed
